<h1>HIS OFFICIAL FIANCÉE</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SUMMONS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“‘<i>A girl without a sweetheart</i>,’ girls—(I
was readin’ something about it this
very morning ’s I was coming along in the
Toob),” chattered little Miss Holt over her
work. “<i>A girl without a sweetheart is like a
ship at sea, without knowing what port she’s to
put in at</i>——”</p>

<p>“Accounts for the way a lot of ’em seem to
pick their sweethearts on the principle ‘<i>Any
port in a storm!</i>’” said Miss Robinson, with
her little sniff.</p>

<p>“Well! Seems to me there’s a good deal
in the idea that a poor husband is better than
none,” came philosophically from Miss Holt,
whose back is always curved like a banana over
her typing-table, and who “smarms” her dull
brown hair down under a hair-net until her head
looks like a chocolate. “After all, my dear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
if you’re married, you’re married; and nobody
can say you aren’t. But if you <em>aren’t</em> married,
you aren’t. And nobody can say you <em>are</em>!”.</p>

<p>“How true,” said Miss Robinson dreamily.
“Got that, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>And she gave a sardonic glance towards me,
to see if I was thoroughly taking this in. I
was trying not to. The buzz of Cockney
whispering which goes on, intermittently, all
day long in our murky “typists’-room” was
beginning to get on my nerves again almost as
badly as it did in the first week that I worked
at the Near Oriental Shipping Agency. I
didn’t raise my eyes. Then, above the click
and the buzz, came a shriller:</p>

<p>“Miss Trant, if you please?”</p>

<p>My fingers fell from the typewriter, and I
looked up with a start into the sharp little
South-London face of our smallest office-boy.</p>

<p>“Yes? What is it, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Miss Trant, Mr. Waters says he wishes to
see you in his private room at two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“To see <em>me</em>?” I asked in a panic; hoping
that it might not be true, that by some lucky
chance my ears had deceived me. They hadn’t.</p>

<p>“Yes; at two o’clock sharp, miss.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Harold,” I heard myself say in
a small, dismayed voice.</p>

<p>Then I heard the door of our room shut upon
the office-boy’s exit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>I turned, to meet the shrewd, sympathetic
brown eyes of Miss Robinson over her machine.</p>

<p>“Governor sent for you?”</p>

<p>I nodded dismally.</p>

<p>“Any idea what it’s about, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it might be about <em>anything</em> this last
week,” I sighed. “It might be about my
forgetting to enclose those enclosures to the
Western Syndicate. Or for leaving out the
P.T.O. at the bottom of that Budapest letter.
Or for spelling Belgium B-e-l-g-u-i-m. Or half
a dozen other things. I knew Mr. Dundonald
was going to complain of me. It’s been hanging
over me for the last three days. Anyhow I
shall know the worst to-day.”</p>

<p>“P’raps he’ll give you another chance, dear,”
said little Miss Holt.</p>

<p>“That’s not very likely,” I said. “He’s
such an abominably accurate machine himself
that he’s ‘off’ anybody in this office who isn’t
a machine too, girl or man.”</p>

<p>“D’you suppose the Governor even knows
which of us <em>is</em> a girl and which is a man? because
I don’t,” put in Miss Robinson. “I bet you
he——”</p>

<p>“Talking in theyairr!” interrupted the
grating Scotch accent of Mr. Dundonald, as he
passed through to the Governor’s room, where,
alas! I, Monica Trant, was soon to present
myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>A deathly silence, broken only by the clicking
of the four typewriters, fell upon our department.</p>

<p>But I’m pretty sure that all the work <em>I</em> did
from then on until lunch-time was of very
little good.</p>

<p>That gloomy typists’ room, looking over the
“well” of the great buildings in Leadenhall
Street, and so dark that we worked always by
electric lights, switched on one over each machine,
faded away from me. I ceased to know I was
breathing in that familiar smell of fog and
mackintoshes and dust and stuffiness. I ceased
to hear the muffled roar of the City outside, and
the maddening “click! click-a-click-pprring!”
of the typewriters within, as I shut myself into
my own mind.</p>

<p>Dismally I reviewed my own situation.</p>

<p class="tb">Here was I, “alone in London,” all my
poor little capital spent on the business-training
which I had joyfully hoped was going to bring
me in a nice “independent-feeling” income of
at least two pounds a week. At the offices of
William Waters and Son, of the Near Oriental
Shipping Agency, a post I had obtained after
weeks of weary searching for work, my salary
was twenty-five shillings a week. <em>Now</em>, in all
probability, I was going to lose even that. And
then what was I to do? How was I to go on
contributing my half of the rent of the Marconi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Mansions flat; how was I to pay for even my
cheap meals and my “these’ll-have-to-do”
clothes? How <em>was</em> I to earn my living?</p>

<p>Obviously, I’m not cut out for a business-girl!</p>

<p>My three months in the office has plainly
shown me that.</p>

<p>“You lack method, Miss Trant”—as Mr.
Dundonald, the head of our department, has
told me more than once. “You lack <em>concentrrayshn</em>.
You are intelligent enough, for a
young lady, but when I think I can rrely on
you, what happens? I find ye out in some
rideeclus mistake that the rrrawest student
from Pitman’s wouldn’t make. And this after
I’ve warrrned you times and again. What
do you think is going to be the end of it?”</p>

<p>Evidently the sack.</p>

<p>And what else <em>is</em> there I can do?</p>

<p>Nothing!</p>

<p>I can’t draw fashion-plates or write articles
for the magazines.</p>

<p>Go on the stage—no, I never <em>could</em> remember
my cue, even in private theatricals. I love
children—but people want diplomas and Montessori
Systems with their nursery-governesses.
For serving in a shop I don’t suppose I’m tall
enough. That’s one of the inconsistencies of
men—they quote poetry about a girl being
“just as high as their hearts,” and then advertise
for parlour-maids and mannequins who must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
stand well over five foot nine, which I don’t.
Though, even if my nickname <em>is</em> “Tots,” thank
goodness I’m not dumpy, like little Miss Holt,
who thinks a poor husband is better than
none....</p>

<p>What about the principal profession open
to women—getting married?</p>

<p>Well, but I never see any men, now a days—you
can’t call things-in-the-City <em>men</em>, exactly—whom
I could get married <em>to</em>. Besides, there’s
nobody, now that I’m an unbecomingly-dressed
pauper, who would want to marry me.—Except,
perhaps ... Sydney Vandeleur ...? Dear old
Sydney is a friend left over from the days before
the smash in our family when “<i>the world was
more than kin when we had the ready tin</i>.” I’ve
seen him several times since, and he was just
the same as ever, so sympathetic and amusing;
such a “pal,” and with something about him
that made me quite certain he’d be ready to
become something more, the minute I encouraged
him.</p>

<p>“Encouraging” him wouldn’t be too unpleasant
either, though I never was in love with
Sydney. By this time I’ve come to the conclusion
that I’m not a bit the falling-in-love
type of girl. Major Montresor, of father’s
regiment in the old days, told my brother Jack
once that “little Monica had the makings of
a first-class flirt; she belonged to the successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Order of the Cold Coquette.” After listening
to the dodderings and drivels and despairs of
girls who <em>aren’t</em> cold, I’m rather thankful that
I <em>am</em>. At least I can be fond enough of
people in a sensible sort of way. I could be
of Sydney.</p>

<p>I suppose it will end in my getting him to
marry me....</p>

<p>But not yet. I haven’t even got his address!
He and his mother have gone on a tour to
Japan, and they won’t be within reach for so
much as a dinner for about a year. Whereas
it’s to-day, <em>this afternoon</em>, that I’m to get the
sack without knowing what else is to happen to
me!</p>

<p>A pretty depressing outlook!</p>

<p class="tb">At one o’clock I went out to lunch at what
the typists here call “The Den of Lyons,” with
Miss Holt and Miss Robinson.</p>

<p>Our fourth typist, pretty, anæmic Miss Smith,
had evidently made other arrangements to-day.
She wore another hat; a fresh bunch of violets
was tucked into her long coat, and she monopolized
the looking-glass while she attended to
her complexion with a pot of face-cream, a
clean hankie, and a book of <i lang="fr">papiers poudrés</i>.</p>

<p>“We’re extremely smart to-day, Smithie,”
said Miss Robinson. “What’s on?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out to lunch with Still Waters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>This was “the” office joke at the Near
Oriental.</p>

<p>“Still Waters” meant no one less than Mr.
William Waters, Junior, the head of the firm,
who acted as General Manager, and from whom
I had just received that fatal summons. He
would as soon think of having a word to say to
one of his typists out of business-hours as of
giving a dance in the office itself. So that the
excuse “<i>I’m going out with Still Waters</i>” always
means that the speaker intends to keep her
engagement to herself. It’s an open secret in
the office that Smithie, who keeps a manicure-set
in her hand-bag and who blushes twice
daily down the telephone, has “got some sort
of boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, haughty! Don’t bother to
apologize,” said Miss Holt. And we left Miss
Smith to her preparations.</p>

<p>Presently we caught sight of her again in the
crowd outside. She didn’t see us, or anything
else, I think. She was smiling and sparkling
and flushed, and “looked as different as a fortnight’s
holiday,” as Miss Robinson said. All
three of us glanced from her to the young man
she was with. To bring <em>that</em> transfiguring light
into a girl’s face, wouldn’t you have expected
him to be a mixture of some Greek God and
Bombardier Billy Wells?—Far from it.
“Smithie’s boy” was scarcely taller than she;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
narrow-chested office-shouldered, with a face
as pale and peaked as a long envelope.</p>

<p>“What a kid!” criticized Miss Holt as we
passed.</p>

<p>“All men <em>are</em> awful kids,” pronounced Miss
Robinson, “but you do bar them looking it.
Of the two, I don’t know that I wouldn’t rather
have ’em like graven images!”</p>

<p>Which brought us back to the horrible subject
of that graven image, our Governor.</p>

<p>Over glasses of hot milk and the poached-eggs-on-toast,
the plates of which rasped on
the marble-topped table of the shop that <em>always</em>
smells of steak-and-kidney pie, the other girls
made themselves specially agreeable to the
colleague who was preparing for the sack in
another hour.</p>

<p>“It is too bad. We shall miss you from our
room,” said good-natured little Miss Holt.
“Still—(Here, miss! I said egg, I didn’t say
sardine-sandwich! I wish you’d attend when
anyone speaks!... She would, if I’d a boy
with me! Such is life!)—Still, it isn’t as if
there wasn’t other posts you could get. Easily.
Don’t you look so hopeless, Miss Trant. You’ve
a taking way with you, and a nice smile; wasn’t
I passing the remark, only the other day, about
what a pretty smile Miss Trant’d got? And,
say what you like, looks <em>do</em> count when a young
lady’s in business!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a pity Miss Trant don’t know she’s
good-looking. We ought to have told her
about that, before,” said Miss Robinson dryly.
“But you’re all right. <em>You’ll</em> get taken on
somewhere where they don’t make an international
affair of it over one misplaced comma
or a tiny smudge off a new ribbon. <em>You’ll</em>
get round the men. I don’t mean Still Waters.
He’s not a man, of course. He’s a machine
that can say ‘<i>Now, Miss Trant!</i>’”—here she
broke into perfect mimicry of the Governor’s
curtest tone. “And’ <i>What is the meaning of
this evening’s cables being one-fifth of a second
after time?</i>’ He doesn’t count. You try for
something where there’s a human being at the
head of affairs——”</p>

<p>“And if it’s near she can come out to lunch
with us just the same as before she left,”
suggested Miss Holt.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t even left yet,” said Miss Robinson
encouragingly. “What price one of those
fancy cakes, Miss Trant? Choose the least
poisonous-looking, and I’ll treat you—for luck!”</p>

<p class="tb">At a quarter to two we got back to the office.</p>

<p>I went and washed in the dressing-room. I
took down all my hair. My hair’s my pet
vanity; it’s very long and thick and silky, and
“just the colour of massed black pansies against
her honeysuckle-coloured flesh-tints,” as Sydney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Vandeleur once said. He “puts” everything
like the artist that he is. (Oh, why wasn’t it
to meet <em>him</em> that I was preparing, instead of
that young frozen ogre of a Governor?) I
wound the long swathe smoothly round my head
again, pinned it firm, and made sure it was all
right at the back, <em>not</em> with any idea of impressing
Still Waters (who would scarcely have noticed
the fact had all his typists been completely bald,
so long as they were efficient), but merely
because to feel perfectly neat made me a little
less painfully nervous.</p>

<p>The clock, striking two, chimed in with my
humble tap at the door of Mr. Waters’ private
room.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called the dreaded voice of our
Governor.</p>

<p>And, trembling inwardly, in I went.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PROPOSAL</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The large, light room, with its handsome
furniture, seemed to stretch for miles
between the door and the big writing-desk,
covered with green leather, at which Mr. Waters
himself sat, frowning over a letter. The desk
was generally bare but for the note of his day’s
appointments, with the hours, on the turnover
date-ticket.</p>

<p>“Two o’clock,” and a heavy “X” marked
this coming interview, as I could not help seeing
when I finished what seemed like a long and
tiring walk over the thick crimson carpet, and
stood meekly at his elbow.</p>

<p>He looked up, alert, clean-shaven, his fair
hair brushed as sleek and shiny as the nap of
his own silk hat, his mouth closed as tightly as
his own cash-box; he was the very picture
of a successful young City man, whose one and
only interest is his business.</p>

<p>“Ah! That you, Miss Trant?” he said, in
the quick, curt, business-like voice that Miss
Robinson can imitate so perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>He wheeled round in the chair to face me.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please.”</p>

<p>I was thankful to sit down. Although I
don’t think my panic showed in my face, my
knees were actually beginning to give under me.
Mr. Waters pointed to a plump, green morocco-covered
chair. Down I sat, on the very edge
of it. I set my teeth to listen to what this office
tyrant had to say.</p>

<p>(How extraordinary that he and Sydney Vandeleur
should <em>both</em> be “men”!)</p>

<p>If he only wouldn’t keep me; if he’d only
just tell me to go, and get it over....</p>

<p>But his first remark took me absolutely by
surprise.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant. If you don’t mind, I
want to ask you a few questions. Don’t
think them impertinent, for they are not
so intended, and they are necessary to the
matter in hand. And—please don’t misunderstand
them.”</p>

<p>Here his alert face grew even more business-like.
His keen grey eyes met my startled brown
ones steadily for a moment. Then he added,
in an emphatic, “<em>underlined</em>” sort of tone:</p>

<p>“There is nothing in these questions to which
your father, or anyone belonging to you, could
take any exception. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Understand”—No! I certainly didn’t.
What could he mean me to understand? I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
hadn’t grasped it even when he repeated the
question a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p>“You do understand that, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>“Oh—er—yes—of course,” I murmured, in
duty bound.</p>

<p>But I was so utterly dazed by this unlooked-for
flight-off-at-a-tangent of the Governor’s that I
heard myself answering as if in a dream the
questions he put next.</p>

<p>“Twenty-one. You’re of age, then,” I heard
him saying through the daze. “Both parents
dead: m’m. No one else belonging to you?”</p>

<p>“One brother in South Africa,” my lips
answered mechanically. And my inward wonder,
“<i>What on earth has that got to do with Mr.
Waters?</i>” was mingled with an added dull
twinge of anxiety. For I haven’t heard from
poor old rolling-stoney Jack for three months
or more.</p>

<p>“No one belonging to you in London?
M’m. And you’re dependent for your living
upon what you earn here?”</p>

<p>(Yes! or else I shouldn’t have to sit here
answering questions about things that are absolutely
no business of yours! was what I thought
rebelliously.) I said aloud, reluctantly, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live, then—alone?”</p>

<p>“I share rooms with another girl in Battersea,”
I had to tell him, still wondering resentfully
what in the world might be the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of this catechism. <em>Wasn’t</em> it the prelude to
dismissal, after all, then? <em>Wasn’t</em> he preparing
to be hateful and sarcastic, and to tell me he
felt my talents were being wasted at the Near
Oriental (this is one of Mr. Dundonald’s pet
<i lang="fr">clichés</i>), and that he advised me to look out elsewhere
for a better position at a higher salary—if
I could get it? What <em>would</em> be the next
question, then?</p>

<p>It was <em>the</em> last thing that I should have dreamed
of his asking.</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me, Miss Trant, whether
you are engaged to be married?”</p>

<p>Engaged? I? What <em>could</em> he want to know
that for?</p>

<p>That was less his business, even, than any of
the other questions he’d put!</p>

<p>It seemed doubly odd, since I <em>had</em> been meditating
on the possibility of “getting engaged”
that very morning. Ever since twelve o’clock,
the mental image of Sydney Vandeleur’s picturesque,
dark face, with his small Vandyke beard
and gentle, adoring brown eyes, had been very
near me. There was always Sydney in the background,
of course. Backgrounds don’t count,
presumably. Even if they did, though, what
concern was it of my business employer’s? I
did wish I had enough self-assurance to announce
frankly, “Well, I <em>do</em> mind telling you,
as a matter of fact!” But ... twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
shillings a week don’t provide a girl with much
self-assurance!</p>

<p>I could only let him have the literal answer
in return for his direct (and unwarrantable)
question.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I’m not engaged.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Still Waters briskly. (Why
“good”?)</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant, I can tell you the reason—or
part of the reason—I sent for you this afternoon.
I must begin by impressing upon you
very definitely that”—here he paused, and
at each word of the announcement tapped
solemnly on the big desk with his finger—“I
don’t want to get married myself.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” I almost gasped, wondering
what in the world this very obvious truth (for
one <em>could</em> not imagine Still Waters in connection
with marriage or engagements) had got
to do with me?</p>

<p>“At the same time, there are reasons why
for a time, at least—say a year—it should appear
that I was going to be married. I may tell you
those reasons later on; that depends. At
present I’ll merely tell you that it is important
to me that I should be officially, that is nominally,
engaged.”</p>

<p>I gazed at him. There was no more expression
in his face than in the pearl pin in his expensive-looking
grey tie. What could he mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“I wish it to appear to everybody—to my
family, to my acquaintances, to the people in
this office—that I am actually engaged,” he
explained. “I wish to find someone who, to
outward appearances, could take the place of my
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i>; could go about with me, stay at my
home, and be introduced all round as the girl
I meant to marry. She must understand from
the very beginning that it was absolutely a matter
of business; that the so-called ‘engagement’
would terminate at the end of the year, and that
there could be no possible question of its ending
in marriage. If I found this lady, I would make
it worth her while; paying her at the rate of
ten pounds a week for her services. You follow
me, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>I began to “follow,” but I could scarcely
believe that he really intended to carry out this
mysterious scheme. It was more like the plot
of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera than any “business”
I’d ever heard of in real life. Still more
incredible was what came next.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me from the first that the most
suitable person for the post would be—yourself.”</p>

<p>“Me?” I echoed, aghast. Oh, this was
getting out of comic opera, and into the realms
of nightmare! Was he <em>really</em> suggesting that
I——</p>

<p>“Yes; you, Miss Trant. You are a lady in
every essential, if I may say so, of looks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
manner. You seem to possess the gift of making
yourself generally liked. You’re distinctly intelligent,
in spite of your work, which is——” here
for one instant a gleam of what looked almost
like humour seemed to flash from the Governor’s
eyes. But it was gone again so swiftly that I
couldn’t be sure whether it had ever been there.
I must have been mistaken. He went on imperturbably:
“I am a very fair judge of character,
and I believe you to be trustworthy. As a mark
of my confidence in you, I shall pay into your
account the whole sum of five hundred pounds
so soon as you let me know that you consent to
enter into this arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred pounds?” I echoed stupidly.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is payment for the entire year
at the rate of ten pounds weekly. I hope you
will see your way to accepting it. Think it
over to-night, please,” said Still Waters,
in his curtest, most business-like tone, “and let
me have your answer here—if you can, that is”
(meaning “you must!”) “at eleven-fifteen to-morrow
morning. I need hardly tell you that
this must remain strictly between ourselves.
I think that’s all.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the round-topped mahogany
clock above the fireplace, then put his hand out
to the row of electric-bell pushes on his desk.
Our interview was over.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Miss Trant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” I murmured rather
feebly, as I retraced my steps over that long,
long stretch of carpet to the door.</p>

<p>I felt furious with myself for lacking the ordinary
pluck to tell the Governor then and there:</p>

<p>“I shan’t need to-night to think the question
over. My answer is ‘No!’ I can’t possibly
undertake such an arrangement.”</p>

<p>For how can I? How can I accept such an
extraordinary position? “Officially” engaged
to the Governor—the office tyrant, the mummy,
the fault-finding automaton! Fancy “going
about” with him, letting everyone imagine that
I was actually going to marry him! Fancy
playing that Gilbertian part, with no rouge
and no fun and no footlights to carry me through
it, in a “piece” that went on all day and every
day! And fancy—this was almost the most
appalling thought of all—fancy having to face
all the other girls in the office.</p>

<p>Oh, impossible; quite impossible! I can’t
do it. I must summon up all my courage and
tell him so to-morrow.</p>

<p class="tb">“Well?” whispered Miss Robinson, from the
next typing-table. “What <em>did</em> the graven
image say? Was he a brute? <em>Is</em> it the sack?
Or is he giving you another chance?”</p>

<p>“I think he means to give me another chance,”
I murmured. (Such a chance!) “I am——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Talking</em>, ladies!” broke in the warning.
“Miss Trant, it’s generally you, I notice!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Dundonald’s voice brought back
the bugbear that has haunted me since twelve
this morning—the terror of being penniless and
out of work once more.</p>

<p>Oh, if I could only attain to some job, <em>some
other job</em>, that would bring me in that princely
salary of ten pounds a week! Imagine the
blessed relief, the security of knowing that one
had five hundred pounds in one glorious, solid
lump at one’s back. But then, imagine accepting
the Governor’s terms before one earned it!
Oh, no!</p>

<p>The bogey “<i>out of work</i>” haunted me down
into the Tube lift, along the Embankment, all
the way back up our grey Battersea street, with
the red-faced pavement-artist who always touches
his cap to me, smiles and points to his lurid
chalk-drawing of a wreck with the legend:
“<i>Like the Artist—On the Rocks!</i>”</p>

<p>“I’m on the rocks myself, Blossom. This
is probably the last penny I shall be able to give
you!” I told him, with a desperate little laugh.</p>

<p>Then I turned in at the entrance to Marconi
Mansions, and climbed up our stone stairs to
the cheap but cosy little top-flat which has for
six months meant “Home” to us two bachelor
girls.</p>

<p>How long should <em>I</em> be able to afford to share it?</p>

<span class="smaller">THINKING IT OVER——</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I always expect to be in long before Cicely
Harradine, the girl who shares the place
with me. We first made friends in a ten-shillings-a-week
bedroom at the Twentieth Century
Club, when she was left much as I was, a waif
without any friends that counted, and with just
a tiny lump of capital. This she used up in paying
her fees at the Slade School of Art, where
she’d gone, in her innocence, with a view to
taking up fashion-drawing. They all used to
say at home that she’d “a gift” for sketching,
and she’d heard—we’ve all heard!—that there
are fortunes to be made out of fashion-plates.
Only she hadn’t realized that for a girl of her
sort, lovely and good-hearted and “gormless,”
there’s only one way of getting a fortune;
namely, by marrying it. And how <em>can</em> you
marry, as she often says plaintively, if you never
even <em>see</em> any “possible” men? All the people
she seems to see nowadays—besides Slade
students—are the gorgeous Jewesses who deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
at the “studio” where Cicely’s one real “gift”
(that of a tall, willowy figure) is now turned to
advantage by showing off the evening-frocks
and opera-wraps of Madame Chérisette, in
Bond Street, in the show-rooms she can seldom
leave until well after seven o’clock.</p>

<p>So to-day I was astonished to find the second-hand,
cretonne-covered couch in our sitting-room
already occupied by what looked like a
bundle of rugs, dishevelled red curls, and arnica
bandages, whence proceeded the sound of dismal
sobs.</p>

<p>“Cicely!” I cried, alarmed. “You back
already? Why, what’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, such an <em>awful</em> catastrophe!”
wailed the voice of Cicely, while the willowy
figure twisted itself into sitting up against our
cheap flock cushions. “What do you think?
When I went out to lunch this morning I
managed to slip on a bit of banana-skin that
some perfect <em>pig</em> had flung down at the crossing—No,
Tots! it <em>wasn’t</em> those shoes I will wear,
so you needn’t say that!—and I twisted my
ankle and cut my head on the kerb, and I had to
be brought home in a taxi, and the doctor’s
been, and he says I’m to keep my foot up for a
fortnight, and what—what on earth’s to become
of my job?” wept Cicely. “Chérisette won’t
take me on again, for there’s a girl waiting <em>now</em>
for my place! A <em>niece</em> of somebody’s! She’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
<em>snap</em> it up! And <em>what</em> am I to do? Hurp,
hurp!”</p>

<p>She could only sob, and I could only stroke
her pretty, incompetent fingers.</p>

<p>“There’ll be that <em>doctor</em> to pay! And it’ll
be the <em>rent</em> again in three weeks’ time! It’s
<em>always</em> being the rent, in this place, Tots! It
<em>never</em> was at home. And <em>I</em> haven’t got any
money saved now that I’ve bought that bicycle
for Saturday afternoons. Isn’t it perfectly
awful? Hurp, hurp! Oh, girls at home who
get doctors and dentists and washing and everything
<em>f-found</em> for them, hurp! are so fond of
<em>envying</em> girls who earn their own livings because
it’s so free and independent—how <em>can</em> they?
<em>They</em> wouldn’t want to earn their horrible livings
if they <em>only</em> knew how ghastly it was as soon as
you got ill and hadn’t anything but a few shillings
between you and goodness knows!”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Earned increment is sweet, but that unearned
is sweeter</i>,’” I quoted bitterly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you laugh at everything, Tots! This
is serious. <em>S-s-s-seven-and-sixpence!</em> That’s all
I’ve got left in the whole wide world! And
<em>you’ve</em> nothing but your twenty-five bob a
week!”</p>

<p>(Yes! I thought; and even that modest salary
will be lost to me to-morrow. For when I
tell the Governor that I find I can’t accept his
offer, he’s pretty certain to sack me. After his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
allusion to my “work,” after Mr. Dundonald’s
“warrrnings,” what else need I expect? But
this wasn’t the moment to tell my poor, distracted
chum my own bit of bad luck. Even if
we <em>were</em> both out of work and on those rocks
together, it must, for the present at least, be
kept from <em>her</em>.)</p>

<p>“Now look here, don’t you worry,” I said,
more cheerfully than I felt. “You <em>know</em> you’re
no end of a ‘find’ as a mannequin, because you’ve
got the voice that goes with the figure. It must
be rather a shock when Madame’s clients ask
something that looks like a young duchess in a
dream of a gown ‘<i>What did you say the price
was?</i>’ and get told in the accents of Whitechapel
‘<i>Twenty-ite paounds, Madam!</i>’ That’s
the pull <em>you’ve</em> got, so you know you’re sure of
another good place as soon as your foot’s right.
Until then I—I can manage perfectly well for
the two of us. What about something to eat?
Mrs. Skinner coming back to cook to-night?”—Mrs.
Skinner is <em>supposed</em> to “do” for us. I
often think that, in another sense, she <em>will</em>!</p>

<p>“No. She’s off for the whole day to go to a
funeral. You said she might, this morning.”</p>

<p>“So I did. I thought it was a week ago—it
feels like it. Well, I’ll get supper.”</p>

<p class="tb">As I passed into our little dark cubby-hole of
a kitchen, I saw something that I’d overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
before—a letter left lying on the mat, as it had
dropped through the letter-box. I picked it
up. It was addressed to me. And at the sight
of the thin foreign envelope and the South
African stamp my heart sank even lower. I had
a presentiment that I hadn’t come to the worst
yet.</p>

<p>It was a letter from my brother in Cape Town;
poor old ne’er-do-weel Jack, who scarcely ever
writes anything more than a picture postcard
with a view of the Cape of Good Hope, or something
of that kind, unless he’s in trouble and wants
something.</p>

<p>With a sigh I took out the crackling, scrawled
sheet; and my eyes fell on the last sentences
first.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>You’ll have to get the money for me, old
girl. You know you can if you try. Ask
Vandeleur to lend it to us; he’d do anything
for you. Haven’t got his address, or I would
have written to him myself. I am absolutely
on the rocks, so don’t wait. You’ll have to
wire a hundred pounds to the Bank here——</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>A hundred pounds? Mightn’t he just as
well have said “a million”? What was all this
about? I took the letter into my own little
room and sat down on the camp-bed to read
it through....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>In five minutes I have grasped all that I can
take in at present of the situation; an old one.</p>

<p>Jack is in trouble, worse trouble than ever
before. Debts; an I O U that was to fall
due in six weeks. Threatened exposure of—<em>something</em>
that he doesn’t explain. “<i>A business
affair?</i>”</p>

<p>Yes; Mr. Dundonald is quite right. I
<em>have</em> “no head for business routine.” My
head’s going round with the bewilderment of
it. It <em>can’t</em> mean that Jack, my own brother,
Father’s only son—one of the <em>Trants</em>—has been
“not quite straight” with the accounts that
are in his care? He must be mad! It must
be the hot sun in that awful country. Not
<em>Jack</em>——!</p>

<p>But to suggest that I should turn to Sydney
Vandeleur for the money, even supposing that
I knew where the Vandeleurs were to be found
just now—oh! As if I wouldn’t rather die!
Yet there’s nothing else that I can do——</p>

<p>Stop. There is one thing.</p>

<p>For, as if flashed in letters of fire over the
dim purple sky over the London roofs outside
my window, I seem to see the words—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And they mean, not only a solution of the
difficulties of Miss Trant, typist, not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
comforts and security for Cicely, the show-girl
out of work, but the saving of our family name
and honour from disgrace. Help instead of
ruin for that poor dear weak-kneed broken reed
of a brother of mine.</p>

<p>It’s Providence, that wildly eccentric scheme
of the Governor’s. I don’t care what its object
may be. I only know that now—<em>now</em>—I daren’t
refuse to fall in with it. Never mind the details.
The main fact is that <em>I must have that hundred
pounds, and this is the only way to it</em>.</p>

<p class="tb">I’ve just taken supper into our sitting-room,
and I’ve been able to smile quite recklessly down
into the woe-begone, girlish face under the
arnica bandages.</p>

<p>“Buck up, Cis, and eat some really good
scrambled eggs with little bits of ham chopped
up in them. And then there’s some glass
loganberries, hot; and somebody’d been what
Mrs. Skinner calls ‘pampering the milk,’ so I
got a brown jar of cream for them. <em>One</em> comfort
of living in a <i lang="fr">ménage</i> without any <em>men</em> (a joke, so
please laugh) is that we can eat what we <em>like</em>,
instead of stodging horrible, gristly chops and
steaks and potatoes every night of our lives.
And I brought in some red ink—not Veuve Emu
this time, but really decent Burgundy to cheer
us up——”</p>

<p>“But, my <em>dear</em>—!” protested Cicely, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the scared glance of the business-girl who knows
what it costs to eat and drink.</p>

<p>“It’s not extravagance. I can afford it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t! You can only <em>just</em> manage to
scrape along for yourself—and you know your
poor darling hat’s awful, and you told me you
couldn’t get another—you haven’t managed to
put by a penny for ‘extras’—you told me
yesterday——”</p>

<p>“Ah, yesterday! But I shall have some more
money—<em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>“What?—and you never told me when you
came in? What, have Waters and Son actually
given you a <em>rise</em>?”</p>

<p>“Supplementary duties,” I explained briefly,
drawing a wooden chair up beside Cicely’s couch
and laying a clean towel over it for a tablecloth
before I set down the plate of ham-scramble.
“Pretty well-paid, too. Yes. I got the job
to-day. And,” I concluded with resolution,
“I begin it to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">ACCEPTED!</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“And when do you think the ‘engagement’
had better be announced? At once?”</p>

<p>This was what the Governor said to me this
morning when I again presented myself at his
desk; this time with the timid “acceptance”
which, after poor Jack’s desperate appeal, is
my only alternative.</p>

<p>“At <em>once</em>?” I gasped. “Oh, but—How
could it? The—well—people would think it
so”—I checked a hysterical laugh—“so
<em>funny</em>!”</p>

<p>“Funny? What’s funny about it?” took
up the Governor, as sharply as if he didn’t see
anything at all odd in the whole situation. But
he does. He <em>must</em>! What a hateful trick
men have of pretending they’re <em>not</em> pretending—when
you’re unable to prove, in so many words,
that they <em>are</em>! People talk about women being
more complicated; good gracious! It’s we
who are simple and straightforward. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
was I to make of the Governor, when he asked
me, in quite an annoyed tone of voice, “I suppose
men at the heads of offices have become engaged
to their employees before now Miss
Trant?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes—of course—<em>Become engaged</em>.”—He
was talking now as if <em>this</em> were <em>that</em>!—“But not
if——”</p>

<p>“Not if what?”</p>

<p>“Well, not if they have never seen them to
speak to!” I explained falteringly. “You
see, Mr. Waters, the three other typists in my
room——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Those girls!” said Mr. Waters
casually, and I caught my breath.</p>

<p>For in the tone of those two words from the
Head of Affairs I heard the rest of his meaning—“If
<em>they</em> think it odd—if <em>they</em> make difficulties,
they can go, at once.”</p>

<p>I saw that nightmare threat of “the sack”
looming again, this time over the heads of three
girls who had worked with and always been very
decent to me. They—if they stood the least
bit in this young office tyrant’s way—could go!</p>

<p>“It’s not only the girls,” I urged, clenching
my hands to keep them from shaking, and hating
the man who made me so nervous. “It’s—everybody.
Mr. Dundonald, Mr. Alexander,
they must all know that you scarcely exchanged
a word with me until you sent for me yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
when we—they all thought you were going to
dismiss me——”</p>

<p>“Ah?” said the Governor coolly.</p>

<p>“—S-so I can’t tell them, right on the top
of <em>that</em>, that we are actually engaged to be
married! There’ll have to be—some—some
other sort of warning!”</p>

<p>“Don’t see the necessity myself,” said
Still Waters, fixing those keen grey eyes
upon me as if I were a letter-file or a paper-weight,
or some other inanimate object that
they’d happened to fall upon while he was
meditating on other things. I wondered if he
were thinking that, sooner than be bothered
over this affair, he would sack Mr. Dundonald,
Mr. Alexander and his whole staff! “Still,
if you prefer it. You mean that there had
better be some intermediate stages; that I
ought to begin by singling you out from the
others, seeing more of you, and so on. Quite
so.”</p>

<p>It was uncanny, the cut-and-dried way in
which he spoke of proceedings which—well, are
always looked upon as so intensely the opposite
of cut-and-dried! This affair was the imitation
of something very different; still, one
hardly expected him to be able to map it all out,
like the diagrams in scientific dressmaking!</p>

<p>“Now, how am I supposed to ‘see more’
of you?” he went on, in the same tone as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
might have asked, “<i>Where must I join this dotted
line to section D?</i>”</p>

<p>“Ah, I have it.” (The sections were
beginning to fit in neatly.) “You will come
into my room here each afternoon in Mr.
Alexander’s place, and take down my letters.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I agreed, relapsing into my
usual outward meekness and inward rebelliousness.</p>

<p>What a <em>fearful</em> nuisance, to be banished to the
Siberia of the Governor’s private room, after
the murky but cheery atmosphere of the typists’
“glory-hole,” and the society of three other
girls!</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I should have used
the shibboleth of my set at home to describe
these same girls—“Terrible!—Impossible!” I
should have noticed nothing about them beyond
their cheap “stock” clothes and the Cockney
accents that used to be such an hourly jar to my
nerves. I shouldn’t have differentiated the
sentimental “Smithie” from Miss Robinson,
who has more capacity in her carbon-stained
little finger than most of the girls who were with
me at Wycombe Abbey had in their heads. I
should scarcely have considered them of the
same race of being as myself, and as for being
on friendly, talkative terms with them—Well,
having to fend for oneself in the labour-market
does knock a good deal of the nonsense out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
one. Here I was, quite annoyed at the prospect
of giving up the companionship of the three
for the afternoons!</p>

<p>Still, it would be worth it. My employer
would be as good as his word about the five
hundred pounds. He’d open an account for
me. And at lunch-time I shall be able to cable
that much-needed hundred to Cape Town.</p>

<p>I’m to begin earning it as private clerk—to a
living tape-machine!</p>

<p>“Yes. That will be quite the best plan,”
he went on. “That will pave the way for it.”
His tone became if anything more “scientifically
diagrammatic” still as he said, “To-day
is May fourteen; let me see—How long do
you suppose it would take before it would
be considered the natural thing for me to fall
in love with you?”</p>

<p>“‘Natural’? How could it ever be considered
natural” was on the tip of my tongue,
“for you to fall in love with anybody?—You,
who think it ought to be mapped out into a
certain number of days, like that sum about
‘<i>twenty reapers reaping so many acres in a
week</i>.’”</p>

<p>Primly I answered aloud, “I should think you
could please yourself, Mr. Waters.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will see about that presently,”
said my employer, turning to the desk. “And
now there is this——” After speaking about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
“the time it took to fall in love,” I thought
he’d reached his limit. But no. He went
further.</p>

<p>From a drawer that he unlocked he took out
a paper that he handed to me.</p>

<p>“I have taken the precaution of having our
whole arrangement put down in black-and-white,
if you will kindly sign it here.”</p>

<p>—“In <em>black-and-white!</em>”—“<em>sign——!</em>”</p>

<p>I felt the angry colour surging up into my
face; I was all the more furious because I dare
not show the real rage I was in.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I’ll sign it,” I said, with desperate
meekness, “if you really think it’s necessary.
If you imagine that I am the kind of girl who
might take advantage of our—our contract
afterwards, sue you for breach of promise,
or——”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” Still Waters interrupted
briskly, peremptorily. “It’s just because I
didn’t think you were ‘that kind of girl,’ amongst
other reasons, that I selected you for my post.
This instrument is drawn up largely on your
own account. You have a pen——?”</p>

<p>I took it out of the case fastened to the front
of my very utilitarian blue delaine blouse. I
hate wearing it there. I always look upon it as
the sign of servitude and the mark of the beast,
but it’s the custom—and business-like.</p>

<p>“Right. Now, Miss Trant, I think that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
all for this morning. You can arrange to come
in and take down my letters each afternoon at
a quarter to three, beginning to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, in my meekest tone.</p>

<p class="tb">Loud were the murmurs of commiseration
that broke from my three friends in my
own room when they heard of this novel
arrangement.</p>

<p>“What, my dear? <em>You</em> to take down his
old letters? That’s the Governor’s idea of
giving you one more chance, I suppose,”
sniffed Miss Robinson, “before he sacks you!
Pity he didn’t tell you to go, and get it over
yesterday!”</p>

<p>“He’s simply impossible to please. Why,
when I come here first,” said Miss Holt, “he
had had three girls at it in one week and they all
came out in tears because the Machine had
snapped their heads off. For one thing, he
dictates at such a rate that I don’t know
how he expects anyone to follow him without
they have to ask him to repeat it, and <em>then</em> he
glowers at you like a Gordian! See if he
doesn’t!”</p>

<p>“It’ll be ‘<i>Now, Miss Trant!</i>’” mimicked
Miss Robinson, gabbling at top-speed. “‘<i>Got
that? Go on</i>—</p>

<p>“‘<i>We can offer no further explanation of same
beyond facts already supplied, and are of opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
that there is nothing to be gained by prolonging
this correspondence.</i>’ Certainly nothing to be
gained by you, my poor dear!”</p>

<p>“No, he’ll be sending for that stolid Scotch
Sandy back before the afternoon’s over!”</p>

<p>“Don’t discourage the girl too much before
she starts. Still, I wish you weren’t forsaking
our room for the afternoons, Miss Trant. We
shall miss your merry prattle and your footstep
on the stair.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there won’t be much prattling for
you in there,” said Miss Smith. “More like
sitting among the mummies and sphinxes and
things in the British Museum. Girls, can you
imagine Still Waters ‘prattling’ to anybody,
even as a little boy?”</p>

<p>“That man was never anything so human as
a little boy,” declared Miss Robinson. “He
was created grown-up and ready-made and put
together like a Remington. Probably in the
very act of clicking out—</p>

<p>“‘<i>Contract B.954. Our buyers advise us as
under</i>,’ and so on.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind what I betted that <em>he</em>
never cried over going to school for the first
time, or began to fancy himself more when
he’d sat out at a dance and flirted——”</p>

<p>“<em>Flirted!</em> The Governor!” I put in—quite
forgetting What would presumably be my
cue very soon, and laughing with the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“You might just as well think of him falling
really desperately in love with——”</p>

<p>“<em>Talk</em>-ing, ladies,” broke in the usual voice,
followed by the usual lull.</p>

<p>But the usual twinge of fear didn’t visit me
this time.</p>

<p>Let Mr. Dundonald report me; let him
complain of me, bitterly, to the Governor if
he likes! All Caledonia, stern and wild, can’t
get me turned out of the Near Oriental <em>now</em>.
To-morrow sees me unshakably installed as—the
Governor’s private clerk!</p>

<p class="tb">I must say Mr. Waters is even more paralysingly
alarming to work for in this capacity.</p>

<p>His dictation—Well! Miss Robinson described
it. He simply doesn’t realize, doesn’t
<em>mean</em> to realize, that “a clerk” is composed of
anything more than a pad and a scurrying
pencil. He literally does not <em>see</em> that these
objects may be trembling in the grasp of the
anxious slip of a young woman, who has to
guide them! He’s excruciatingly particular
about the transcribing of his sheaf of letters.
And I shudder—that is, I <em>should</em> have shuddered
only last week—to think what would happen
to Miss Trant, typist, if she brought in anything
to be signed one second after four-thirty,
which is his time for leaving.</p>

<p>But now I’m secure in the knowledge that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
however much that machine of a young man
with the closed cash-box of a mouth may long
to sack me as a typist, my other, more lucrative,
post could not be so easily filled.</p>

<p>Hurray!</p>

<p class="tb">To-day is Friday: that Day of Terror in
the office, the day of the outward mails. But
it’s brought no terror to me. My week’s salary,
if you please, has amounted to eleven pounds,
five shillings.</p>

<p>Twenty-five shillings of that was paid out to
me in the usual way by Mr. Wallis, our cashier—little
dreaming that my purse was already
bulging with ten more than welcome sovereigns
that I got in exchange for my own cheque
(The grandeur of that!) at the Bank where
that providential five hundred pounds (four
hundred since) has been put down to the
account of “Miss M. Trant.”</p>

<p>I daren’t allow myself to think what would
have happened if it hadn’t been for that.</p>

<p>As it is, I am able to take home quite a lot
of invalid dainties to Cicely (left to the tender
mercies of Mrs. Skinner) as well as a lovely
lemon-coloured azalea in a pot, and a brand-new
novel (four-and-six—half her share of the house-keeping
money!).</p>

<p>Spending this fortune will come fatally easily
to me, I know. But I’ve a dim presentiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that the earning of it isn’t going to be as easy
as that!</p>

<p>This morning, which now seems about a year
since I began my “supplementary duties,”
Harold summoned me to appear at twelve o’clock,
instead of after lunch, before the
Governor.</p>

<p>First of all I was seized with nervous flurry,
wondering what on earth I’d done. Then I
remembered that it wouldn’t really matter about
that. What mattered was what I should <em>have</em>
to do next?</p>

<p>There was another cut-and-dried plan for
this in the very tone of the Governor’s “Good
morning” when he glanced up to see me standing
submissively beside his desk again.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant, you have been working
in here exactly a fortnight,” he reminded me.</p>

<p>“Exactly a fortnight.” I wonder if he is
going to keep count of every one of the three-hundred-and-sixty-five
days of the year which
must elapse before I shall be able to say a gleeful
good-bye to him and his diagrammatic “engagement?”
I expect so: I expect there’s a time-table
for each one, drawn up and carefully put
away for reference in one of the locked drawers
of his big cleared desk.</p>

<p>“I think that something more might be
done at once about this arrangement of ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>(A fortnight! Neither too long nor too short
a time, he probably considered, for some
“fresh development” to take place.)</p>

<p>“So what about my taking you out to lunch
to-day?”</p>

<p>What about it? A vivid mental picture of
the expression on the faces of Miss Robinson,
Miss Holt and Smithie rose before me. What—<em>what</em>
would they look like when——Well!
They’ve <em>got</em> to look it sooner or later, so it might
as well <em>begin</em> to-day.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I nearly said. Then I hesitated.
No! Why <em>should</em> he be able to “fit in” every
single detail of his plans, with the ease of a born
jig-saw genius? Why shouldn’t he have to
make some rearrangement, consult someone
else’s convenience for <em>once</em> in his life? I would
just try to put my tiny little spoke in his wheel
here, to <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Waters, would you mind making it
to-morrow instead?”</p>

<p>“Much the same to me,” returned my employer
rather unexpectedly—still, I suppose he
<em>would</em> allow a twenty-four hours’ margin in
these arrangements, in case of accidents. “But
why wait?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because”—No woman ever does
anything for <em>one</em> unadulterated motive; a thing
men won’t understand! So I had my second
choice of reasons quite ready, and it was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
naturally, as well as truthfully (for I <em>was</em> thinking
of Smithie’s preparations for an outing), that I
suggested—“it would seem more ‘natural’ if
I were to have on a new—my best hat to go out
to lunch in instead of the little old cap I put on
because of this drizzle to-day.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Very well,” said Mr. Waters, with
his succinct nod. He added, “I suppose that
sort of thing is what they mean when they
say—when <em>women</em> say—that women have a
much better eye to detail in business than
men have?”</p>

<p>(I don’t <em>quite</em> know how he meant that. But
never mind, Mr. Cut-and-Dried. I <em>have</em> altered
your time-table by a day, at least!)</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then,” said Mr. Waters, after
I had said “Is that all?” And I went.</p>

<p class="tb">The next day was a regular “new-hat” day.
Just the sort of day to go out to lunch with a
“hovering” <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>—a real one!—I thought, as I
set off down the Embankment, leaving Cicely,
whose foot isn’t quite right even yet, at the
open sitting-room window with a novel.</p>

<p>It was brightly sunny, but, although we’re
nearly in June now, there was a nip of cold in
the breeze; the smile of a flirt—of a “cold
coquette,” as Major Montresor described me
once. I wonder what <em>he’d</em> think if ever he met
me again? Probably that it was just like little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Monica to “pull off” making a good match
with another froggy-natured person.</p>

<p>I laughed at this as I was walking along to the
corner where I get the motor-bus. After all,
there’s nothing to do but laugh at it—at the
whole affair. Actually, it was a momentous
choice to have thrust upon any girl; and it
might have cruelly embarrassing side-issues.
But what’s the good of dwelling on momentous
and cruel aspects of subjects that <em>have</em> a comic
side to them? The only way is to look hard at
that comic side—to see the joke, the whole
joke, and, most important of all, <em>nothing but the
joke</em>.</p>

<p>I felt satisfactorily strung up to the coming
“fun” of the situation when I got into the
typists’ dressing-room at the Near Oriental.</p>

<p>Here I found Miss Holt listening to Miss
Smith, evidently a little headachy and nervous,
attempting to “stand up” to Miss Robinson
in some argument.</p>

<p>“The matter with <em>you</em>,” she was saying
pettishly, “is that you’re setting up to be a
<em>man</em>-hater!”</p>

<p>“Setting up? No such luck,” said Miss
Robinson, maddeningly good-tempered. “If <em>I</em>
could ever see a fellow I didn’t think was awful,
I’d begin thinking of setting up. But where
<em>are</em> all the men, good gracious? What does
a girl ever see, working in holes of offices?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Weeds! Indoor weeds, smelling of stale Virginians
and wearing Number Thirteen collars.”</p>

<p>“Collars aren’t anything!” Miss Smith
flushed an angry pink.</p>

<p>“No; but what they go round are. And I
must say I like to see a chap with a good,
thick, strong-looking one (that’s why all the
<em>nice</em> girls love a sailor, Smithie) with plenty of
sunburn and no spots on it, and—Hul-<em>lo</em>, Miss
Trant!”</p>

<p>I had turned up at the right moment to
prevent a squabble—I and my brand-new hat
bought out of Chérisette’s window, no less!
and provided by the princely salary.</p>

<p>“I say, Miss Trant, my child, you’re blossoming
out!” commented Miss Holt, all eyes and
envy. “How much did that roof cost you?
It’s a good one.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> rather a good one,” I admitted quietly.
“I’m so glad you like it.”</p>

<p>But I said no more until the morning’s work
was over and we had trooped back into the
dressing-room to get ready for going out at one
o’clock. Then:</p>

<p>“I can’t come to lunch to-day,” I said, drawing
on the deliciously “fresh”-feeling white
gloves I’d bought for myself at the same time
as the hat, and giving a glance round the dressing-room
to make sure that they all took in the next
announcement. “I’m going out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Who with?” seemed to burst, of its own
accord, from three pairs of lips at once.</p>

<p>Drawing myself up to what there is of my full
height, I smothered an inclination to giggle
foolishly, and answered with starchy dignity,
“Since you <em>must</em> know, I’m going out to lunch
with Still Waters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, give that old joke a rest,”
urged the most frequent user of “the old joke,”
Miss Smith, flushing anew with interest, “and
tell us who HE is! This is something quite
new, Miss Trant, isn’t it? Doesn’t she look
conscious, girls? Didn’t I know that hat meant
something? How exciting! I’m <em>so</em> glad, dear;
but, do tell us! Not his name, of course——”</p>

<p>For in the code of these girls, it’s not fair to
ask for names.</p>

<p>“—but just his <em>Christian</em> name!”</p>

<p>“William,” I admitted, smiling as “coyly”
as I could.</p>

<p>“William! Sounds a bit—stand-offish,” objected
Miss Holt. “D’you call him ‘<i>Billy</i>,’
by any chance?”</p>

<p>“Never,” I said solemnly, “not by any
chance.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. ‘Billy’s’ no class,” said
Miss Robinson. “‘William? Ahem! <em>William!</em>’”
in a pompous bass voice. “Dark or
fair, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>“Fair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“M’m. Well, I suppose Miss Trant <em>would</em>
pick a fair one, her being such a reel brunette,”
commented Miss Holt, “but as for me, I never
could take to a fair man. Puts me in mind of
weak tea. About as fair ’s the Governor, Miss
Trant?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es; just about.”</p>

<p>“Anything for a bit of a change,” said Miss
Robinson satirically. “I should have thought
you’d have liked another colour to sit opposite
to at lunch, after having to have the same sort
of thing staring you in the face all the afternoon.
However!—no accounting for ’em!... I hope
he’s tall, though?”</p>

<p>“Over six foot, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Well grown, William! Is the young
gentleman in the City, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a good sort, answering all our
impertinent questions like this! One more,
Miss Trant, and we won’t bother you. Where
are you going to meet him?”</p>

<p>I don’t think she expected that I <em>would</em> answer
this. But I said quite frankly, “I am to meet
him just outside the front entrance in Leadenhall
Street.” And I whisked out of the room
to the lift. I didn’t tell the girls “Look out of
that window on the other side of the landing
and you’ll see him.”</p>

<p>I knew it wasn’t necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>In two minutes’ time I was being helped into
a taxi by the august hand of our Governor
himself.</p>

<p>I lifted my head and looked straight up at
the landing window. Yes, there they were, all
three of them, flattening their noses against the
pane. I nodded and smiled with bravado.
My three colleagues were too utterly taken by
surprise to even smile back at me. The expression
on their three faces was even more
pronounced than as I had foreseen it. Miss
Holt was standing in front, and as we drove away
I saw her eyebrows rise to her netted hair, while
her mouth dropped open.</p>

<p>I could almost <em>hear</em> the gasp that came from
it, of:</p>

<p>“<em>Girls!</em> Did you <em>ever</em>? She really <em>is</em>!—with
Still Waters! Well! What <em>ever</em> next?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST LUNCH TOGETHER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“To the Carlton,” ordered Mr. Waters;
and off we drove.</p>

<p>I hadn’t been inside the Carlton since the
days before the “smash”—the days when I
was a young lady of leisure, without an idea that
I should presently be toiling in the grimy typists’
room at the Near Oriental from nine o’clock
until six, wearing home-made delaine shirts,
and trembling lest I might lose my hard-earned
twenty-five shillings a week!</p>

<p>The last time I’d been taken there to tea,
after a matinée, by my brother Jack and Sydney
Vandeleur, who had ordered roses of a very
special pink to match the frock I’d worn then,
and had sent a message to the band to play my
favourite waltzes. Yes, as Jack said, Sydney
would do anything for me, always. I expect
Jack thought that the hundred pounds which
saved his name came, as he suggested, from the
Vandeleurs. Well, I couldn’t possibly “give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
away” the truth about the anomalous position
his sister accepted in order to earn the
money!</p>

<p>Thank goodness, the Vandeleurs were at the
other end of the world, and wouldn’t be home
for a year, thought I. By then my time would be
up, and they needn’t know of my make-believe
“engagement”—except that it was “broken
off”!</p>

<p>“I telephoned for a table,” said Mr. Waters,
as we left the ordinary work-a-day world of
hurrying people and crowded, petrol-breathing
motor-buses in the Haymarket, and entered the
restaurant—warm, perfumed, bright with dainty
clothes and pretty faces that smiled above the
little tables.</p>

<p>Ours was in a delightfully cosy corner, next
to an empty table reserved for three persons.
The decorations were of pink hothouse roses,
almost the same as Sydney’s! How very different
from that marble-topped table in the crowded
“Den of Lyons” above which Miss Robinson,
Smithie and little Miss Holt were probably
even now gossiping excitedly over this event;
but <em>how</em> much rather I would have been with
them!</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant, what do you prefer for
lunch?”</p>

<p>(<em>My</em> only variation of lunch for the last year
having been from “Bovril and a baked apple”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
to “Poached-egg-on-toast, with a glass of hot
milk.”)</p>

<p>“I don’t mind at all.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll order.”</p>

<p>And very delicious were the things he did
order. Apparently even a machine liked perfect
<i lang="fr">bisque de homard</i>, and crisp whitebait—his one
touch of nature, in fact.</p>

<p>I longed for Cicely—who does love nice food,
poor child!—to be there to help me enjoy this.
In fact, I wished that Cicely and I could have had
the lunch to our two gossiping selves. How we
should have enjoyed all the luxuries, from the
pretty glass to the freedom to chat, softly but
unrestrainedly, about everyone we noticed in
the place. I have heard it said that “Women
would rather talk to other <em>women</em> than to <em>men</em>,
even when they would rather talk to a <em>man</em> than
to a <em>woman</em>.” I don’t think I’ve often met any
single man I’d rather talk to than to a fairly
amusing member of my own sex. You have to
say most things twice to men, and then they
don’t really understand....</p>

<p>Still Waters, of course (as his typists explain
to each other at least four times in a morning),
isn’t what you could call a man. Somehow, in
surroundings that used to be more familiar to
me than offices and City streets, I lost a little
of that awe-struck nervousness of my employer.
For a time I could almost forget he was that.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
He became—Well! he made me feel as I did
in the old days when I had got someone very
heavy-in-hand to take me in to dinner, or as if
I were sitting out a dance with some rather
hopeless partner. I mean that was about as
far as any conversation between us went—a
few stilted, distrait remarks, punctuating long
stretches of silence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I glanced round the big place at
the other luncheon-parties, people laughing and
chatting together—out evidently for amusement,
not “business”!</p>

<p>Several times I caught glances directed at
our own table. I wondered what the people
were thinking of us—of the enormously tall,
fair young man with “City” stamped all over
him, from his smooth head to his glossy boots,
and the small, dark-eyed girl in the black velours
hat which looked so very much more expensive
and stylish than her neatly-cut but ancient
serge costume would lead them to expect.</p>

<p>Perhaps they thought that the big young man
with the face as expressionless as a fireproof
curtain was slightly bored by taking his country
cousin round the sights of London? Perhaps
they thought we were really engaged? It
didn’t matter. There was no one in the restaurant
who knew either of us. Idly I wondered
who would come in and take the “reserved”
table close to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Trant, you took good care that the
other typists knew for a fact with whom you were
coming out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. They were all looking out of the
landing window as we drove off.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Still Waters.</p>

<p>And again I almost fancied that I caught that
flash of something like humour in his granite-grey
eyes, as I’d fancied it before, when he spoke
about my “intelligence” and my work. But
again it was gone before I could make sure. I
was glad. One doesn’t want a machine to have
any sense of humour. And I shouldn’t find it
so easy and unembarrassing to be on terms of
“official fiancéedom” with anything but a
machine.</p>

<p>“I shall take you out to lunch two or three
times this week,” he announced, in his orders-for-the-day
voice, “and perhaps to tea. On
Saturday I shall ask you to come with me to a
matinée that you can talk about, and so on, to
the others.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Waters,” I said meekly.</p>

<p>“And now that we’ve led up to it in this way,
I see no point in waiting. So next week, Miss
Trant, the ‘engagement’ had better be
announced.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I agreed, again picturing to
myself the stupefaction of everybody at the
Near Oriental, from Mr. Dundonald (a pity the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
shock can’t incapacitate him for life!) down to
Harold.</p>

<p>At home there’d be Cicely. I’m fond of her,
but I dread this. She takes such an <em>exasperating</em>
interest in anything that can be called a
love-affair. I myself can’t see what there is
so thrilling about “Who is going to marry
whom, and why?”</p>

<p>But Cicely positively “collects,” just as some
people collect book-plates, all she can find out
on this hackneyed subject. I know she’ll insist
on treating this arrangement between my employer
and myself as a real, romantic “<i lang="fr">affaire
de cœur</i>.” Well, I suppose I shall <em>have</em> to keep
from slapping her!</p>

<p>Then there’ll be Mr. Waters’ friends, whoever
they are, to whom I shall have to be introduced
as the girl he’s going to marry. (Oh, <em>lor’!</em> as
Mrs. Skinner puts it.)</p>

<p>“After which,” pursued the Governor, “I
think I shall have to ask you to——What is
it, Miss Trant? Just seen somebody you
know?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I managed to murmur; “I know the
lady who has just come in—at the next table.”</p>

<p>For at the table which had been reserved for
three, two of the party had just turned up.</p>

<p>One was a fair-haired young girl, expensively
frocked in blue velvet, but still looking like
school-room tea. The other—how well I knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the slim, well-preserved silhouette of her figure,
the carefully-graded bloom of her face!</p>

<p>It was Lady Vandeleur, whom I’d imagined
to be in Japan!</p>

<p>She is a charming woman, but she has two
faults. One is that, with a son of thirty-two,
she insists on remaining twenty-five. The other
is that, unlike dear old Sydney, to whom the
downfall of the Trant fortunes made absolutely
no difference, she’s never really liked me since
the “smash.”</p>

<p>Before that, she was quite eager to explain
that I was “already” like a young daughter
to her. But it’s two years since I heard the tone
of effusive affection with which Sydney’s mother
was speaking to the girl beside her.</p>

<p>“My dear child, aren’t you <em>starving</em>? I vote
we begin. That naughty boy of mine is so late.
We really can’t wait for Sydney!”</p>

<p>“For Sydney!” Goodness! Then presently
Sydney himself would join them. He would
take the chair that faced our table—to which
his mother sat with her back turned. He
would see me—he’d be sure to come across
and speak!</p>

<p>My mind was in a whirl of wondering what
Sydney Vandeleur would think when he saw the
girl he admired lunching <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> at the
Carlton with that big, imperturbable stranger.
And then Sydney himself came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>I was in the middle of a particularly ambrosial
<i lang="fr">pêche Melba</i>, and anyone would have thought I
didn’t raise my eyes from it. But thank goodness,
my eyelashes are long enough for the purpose
they’re given a girl—to be looked up
through, without a man seeing. In a flash I’d
taken in all of Sydney that one could see; his
general appearance of a Cavalier’s portrait;
his look at the girl, his mood, a slightly different
way he’d had his hair (longish) and his little
Vandyke beard trimmed since I saw him last,
the clothes he was wearing....</p>

<p>Of course nine girls out of ten never notice
a man’s ordinary clothes. Evening-dress they
recognize; and, of course, flannels, because
those are white, and allow the man (especially
after a hard game) to look a decent shape if he
is one. Anything else is lost on them. But I’m
the tenth girl. As Major Montresor once said,
when he was huffy with me for telling him his
new Norfolk jacket was “too undergraduatey”
for him, “Little Monica notices like a valet!”</p>

<p>Sydney’s clothes one couldn’t <em>help</em> noticing;
he’s so well-turned-out, but never in a stereotyped
style; in fact, he refuses to be dressed, as
he calls it, “through a stencil.” I’m sure he’d
rather put on a false nose and walk down St.
James’s Street in it than appear in that hideous
conventional “rig” of the Governor’s. To-day,
for the Carlton, Sydney wore grey of such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
exquisite soft stuff that it was hard to believe it
came from any ordinary man’s tailor; the tie
below his bare throat was dove-colour shot with
heliotrope, and his silk socks and the line in his
shirt with its soft collar matched it exactly.
There was one dark Russian violet in his button-hole.</p>

<p>All these details were familiar to me before
Sydney so much as cast a glance at our table.
Then, in a lull, when I refused coffee, he seemed
to prick up his ears. With a quick turn from the
girl in blue velvet, he looked straight across and
saw me at last.</p>

<p>“<em>Monica——!</em>”</p>

<p>I heard the quick, delighted, recognizing
exclamation break from my old admirer’s lips.
(I <em>know</em> he admires me, so why not say so?)</p>

<p>For the life of me, I couldn’t help raising my
eyes and meeting his own fixed upon me.</p>

<p>He half rose. Then his glance fell upon my
companion. Mr. Waters was then in the act
of putting money down upon the little tray the
waiter handed.</p>

<p>And then I saw the expression of eager delight
on Sydney’s dark, rather dreamy-looking, face
give place to a hurt surprise, as he sat back again
in his chair.</p>

<p>At the same moment Lady Vandeleur turned
quickly, fixing her own gaze upon our table.</p>

<p>Immediately the gaze became a blank stare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
while her exquisitely-pencilled eyebrows rose
almost to the edge of her costly “transformation.”
She’d recognized me, of course. But stony displeasure
and outraged convention gleamed in
the eyes that she instantly averted.</p>

<p>You see, in her world a girl of my age is not
supposed to lunch at the Carlton without a
chaperon of some sort, and with an unspecified
young man.</p>

<p>Up to this occasion I, Colonel Trant’s daughter,
had been of that world, of those conventions.
The Vandeleurs were evidently shocked at the
lapse.</p>

<p>Dear old Sydney, old-fashionedly chivalrous
towards women, was also old-fashionedly strict;
and his mother—well! she was merely glad of
the excuse to cut me.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I need not have
minded. But one is not consistent. I minded
horribly the idea of what they might be thinking
about me—that I had become horrid, forward,
fast.</p>

<p>Something that seemed as hard and hot as a
baked paving-stone seemed to settle between my
chest and my throat as I fumbled at the last
button of my long white gloves, and, in answer
to Mr. Waters’ business-like “Ready, Miss
Trant?” I rose to follow him out.</p>

<p>Lady Vandeleur’s tortoiseshell-handled lorgnette
rose also. I saw her turn a searching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
scrutiny upon my blond, glossily-groomed, well-to-do
looking escort.</p>

<p>Again a horrible hint of what she might be
thinking of me passed through my mind. She
knew I worked now in the City; she would think—Sydney
would think—I had made it an excuse
for “picking up” the attentions of a wealthy
business-man, perhaps my employer. From
every point of view it is considered “bad form”
for the head of a firm to have anything to say to
his typist out of business-hours.</p>

<p>All this she would say to Sydney, and to that
girl. No, I couldn’t stand that! There seemed
only one thing in the world for me to do. “I’m
forced into it,” I thought rapidly, “so here
goes.”</p>

<p>I touched Mr. Waters’s sleeve, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Please wait a moment.”</p>

<p>He stopped, looking down at me inquiringly.
I turned, smiling, to that slim, expensively-gowned
figure of outraged propriety at the other
table. I accosted her as if I thought she had not
seen me.</p>

<p>“Lady Vandeleur, don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>My own voice sounded strangely artificial
in my ears, but, thank goodness, it was steady
enough, with every syllable distinct.</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to introduce Mr. Waters,
my fiancé?”</p>

<p>There! It was said!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Transformation scene upon that carefully-preserved
face at the table! Gone, vanished,
was the icy displeasure. A radiant smile, a
gracious bow to the imperturbable Mr. Waters
met my announcement. An effusive clasp of
both my own hands.</p>

<p>“My dear child, what surprising, what delightful
news! How glad I am for you,” cooed
Lady Vandeleur.</p>

<p>How glad she was for herself—glad to think
that a hopelessly ineligible girl, for whom Sydney
had always displayed a regrettable weakness,
was now safely out of harm’s way—and his!</p>

<p>Her gratification at this made her quite as
affectionate as she had been in the days when the
Trant family was still worth marrying into.</p>

<p>“So long since we heard anything of you, you
naughty child! But this quite makes up. Yes,
we <em>were</em> away; but there were alterations in our
plans”—with a quick gesture, a quick glance,
towards the pretty débutante opposite to her,
evidently her latest “plan” for Sydney. “Now
we are back in town for the season. The old
address, you know, in Belgrave Square. Wednesday
is my afternoon. Now, promise you will
come and see us. A ‘soon’ Wednesday, mind!
Do bring your <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>!”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted.” It was the Governor’s
imperturbable voice that answered her. At
that moment I could not have spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>For as Sydney was murmuring conventional
congratulations I had caught sight of the look
in his eyes. They are handsome eyes, deep and
brown and soft, like the eyes of some spaniels;
and just then they looked so bitterly hurt that I
felt as if I had been cruel to some nice dog or some
helpless child. Perhaps Sydney cared more than
I had ever imagined.</p>

<p>I felt quite miserable when at last the purring
farewells and the “so very glad, dear childs”
were left behind us, and we passed out of the
restaurant, through the wheeling glass doors into
the Haymarket once more.</p>

<p>As we walked up to Piccadilly Circus I turned
to the Governor with the apologies I felt I owed
him.</p>

<p>“I’m so very sorry, Mr. Waters! There
seemed nothing else to be done. Those people—they
were old friends of my father’s; they
would have thought it so odd for me to be
lunching alone with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite so, quite so!” put in the Governor,
matter-of-fact and reassuring. “I quite realized
the situation.”</p>

<p>Did he?</p>

<p>Not all of it! Poor Sydney! I have never
felt nearer the possibility of falling in love with
Sydney in my life. But the Governor was still
speaking.</p>

<p>“In fact, I was not at all sorry that the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
happened to come up. It means, of course, that
the announcement will have to be made rather
earlier.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I agreed, with the usual sinking
of the heart.</p>

<p>We had reached the Circus now, and before I
knew what he was going to do, Mr. Waters had
stepped quickly across to those sailor-hatted,
shawled flower-women, whose baskets make such
a gorgeous splash of colour against the stone
background of the fountain.</p>

<p>Back he came with a cluster of great red,
fragrant carnations, which he handed to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, but really you should not have——”
I was beginning, when I realized that this
also was part of the business—that never had
flowers been offered from man to maid under
quite such unromantic circumstances before,
and that I had better take Still Waters’ gift
as ostentatiously as I could.</p>

<p>I tucked the sweet crimson blooms into the
breast of my blue serge coat.</p>

<p>As we whizzed citywards in a taxi, the
Governor spoke again.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant, there is another suggestion
I have to make to you,” he began. “To
begin with, if I may say so, I like the way you
dress.”</p>

<p>Crisp, concise, business-like syllables; no girl
could have interpreted them into a <em>compliment</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“I like the way you go to business—always
neat, always ladylike. No ear-rings, no dingle-dangles
and low necks like some of them; always
a very clean collar and a quiet tie, I notice—just
the thing for the office. But when I take you
out rather more, I suppose you will have to have
one or two rather special evening gowns and
afternoon frocks, and theatre-wraps, and so on.
I don’t know what they’re called. No doubt
you know the kind of thing to order. All part
of the arrangement, you understand. I’ll get
a friend of mine in the City, whose wife runs a
really first-class dressmaking business, to let
me have the address; and then you will go to
her—”</p>

<p>All cut-and-dried, like all his other schemes!
But this was something different—very different
as well.</p>

<p>—“have yourself fitted out with all that is
necessary, and send in the bills to me.”</p>

<p>“Please, no. Not that,” I heard myself say
quickly.</p>

<p>My employer turned upon me a face with some
of the imperturbability quite jerked out of it by
surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I can’t—I would rather
not do so as you suggest about that,” said I,
holding my head very high, but feeling myself
turn as crimson as the flowers in my coat, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
speaking rather shakily, for this was the first time
I had ever asserted my own feelings in even the
mildest way before him. “I—I know it seems
like straining at a gnat after all the camels that
I am preparing to swallow. Of course I will
<em>get</em> the frocks and things. Only—please, you
must allow me to pay for them out of my
allowance—my salary.”</p>

<p>He looked at me doubtfully.</p>

<p>“That seems scarcely fair—to you. It means
paying out your own money on things, that—well!
I thought that would obviously come out
as ‘<i>business expenses</i>.’”</p>

<p>I said, feeling miserably uncomfortable,
“Don’t you see that I can’t possibly allow you
to pay for—to give me <em>frocks</em>?”</p>

<p>“But—don’t you understand that—in the
way of business, you will have to allow me to
give you other things?”</p>

<p>“Other things? What?”</p>

<p>“Why, presents. I don’t know what, exactly.
You will probably have to come round the
shops with me yourself, and tell me. You are
the best judge of what a girl would like to
show, as gifts, keepsakes, what-nots, from the
man to whom she is, presumably, engaged. It
is part of this affair!” explained Mr. Waters,
a little impatiently, as the taxi was held up
at a crossing and waited panting for the signal
to get on. “It would ‘look odd,’ as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
yourself expressed it once, if I did <em>not</em> offer
you presents.”</p>

<p>“Presents,” I said, feeling really indignant
with him for being so obtuse, “are very different.
For one thing, I should not have to keep
<em>them</em> always. They would go back to you at
the end of the year, as soon as that paper I
signed for you is torn up. But—girls don’t
take <em>clothes</em> as presents, <em>ever</em>!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” he said obstinately.
“Besides—don’t they! A cousin of my own,
a girl” (fancy his having a girl-cousin!)
“who was staying with us last winter used
to wear a magnificent stole and a muff of
leopard-skin—the leopards had been shot by
her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>.”</p>

<p>“Those were <em>furs</em>,” I explained. “Furs are
different.”</p>

<p>“A great many things would seem to be
‘different’ from what I imagined,” he said, in a
tone of voice that was almost petulant. I felt
inclined to say, “Yes! <em>You</em> imagined that
because you’re as infallible as a tape-machine
in business-hours, you can’t make mistakes
outside the office!”</p>

<p>Whereas Sydney Vandeleur, who has no
“business” outside his amateur art criticism,
with an occasional design for hand-wrought
jewellery, would never have made the <i lang="fr">faux pas</i>
this man had done. It was so absurdly ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and <i lang="fr">gauche</i> of him not to see it. And even now
he seemed inclined to dispute the point.</p>

<p>“Feathers, now,” he said a little satirically.
“Might not a girl wear a couple of really good,
expensive ostrich plumes, or whatever you call
them—the things that hang down the back like
a sort of Niagara of fluff—if they were sent to
her by a man with facilities for buying direct
from South Africa?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I said readily, feeling as if I were

“Feathers are <em>quite</em> as permissible as furs.”</p>

<p>“Even supposing them to be very costly?
Worth as much, say, as five times the amount
of the rest of the lady’s wardrobe?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing to do with the cost,” I explained
patiently. “A twenty-guinea fox stole a girl
<em>might</em> accept from a man. A four-pound frock
she <em>couldn’t</em>.”</p>

<p>“I confess I don’t understand these <i lang="fr">nuances</i>,”
said Mr. Waters, almost absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>I said, “Any <em>girl</em> would.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. I can’t help wondering what held
good instead of the fur-and-feathers edict in
the days when they composed——What I was
going to say,” he broke off quickly, “was that I
always imagined that young French girls were
brought up to be more strict in these matters
than English ones. Yet I know a French girl—”</p>

<p>(Surprising! He knows a girl!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>—“her father’s an old business acquaintance
of mine—”</p>

<p>(Ah, that explains it.)</p>

<p>—“and neither her father nor the young
lady seemed to find anything curious about the
matter, when, in payment of some bet made at
a flying-meeting, I bought her quite a large
boxful of pairs of gloves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gloves! Anybody can give gloves to
anybody,” I told him. “<em>Gloves</em> aren’t like
clothes.”</p>

<p>“No, but I see some clothes about nowadays
that are uncommonly like gloves!”</p>

<p><em>Could</em> it have been the Governor who muttered
this <i lang="it">sotto voce</i> to himself?</p>

<p>No! It must have been the comment that
flashed through my own mind, and that I
imagined spoken aloud as the burly policeman
whose back I had been studying during this
interlude dropped his hand and allowed our
taxi to whizz forward into the writhing tangle
of traffic.</p>

<p>There was no further stopping or talking until
at last we reached the imposing entrance of the
Near Oriental Shipping Agency offices.</p>

<p>I noticed that the Governor’s level eyebrows
rose a trifle as he looked at the indicator of the
fares before paying the driver. Yes, I am sure
that many fifteen shillings’ worth of taxi-drive
haven’t seemed as long. I only hope this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
florin’s worth was as endless to him as it was to
me!</p>

<p>Then, just as I was turning away, my employer
surprised me by saying brusquely but quite nicely,
“Miss Trant, you must do just as you like in the
matter of—of which we’ve been speaking. I
didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I am sorry
if I did—You understand that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” I said, all meekness again.</p>

<p>And then I set my teeth before I ran up the
stairs into the typists’ dressing-room and prepared
to face the eyes of my three friends, Miss
Robinson, Miss Holt and Miss Smith.</p>

<hr />

<span class="smaller">WHAT THEY SAID</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the dressing-room, where Miss Robinson
was rinsing out the sooty basin before washing
her hands in it, Miss Holt “smarming” her hair-net
down over her little brown chocolate of a
head, and Miss Smith tearing yet another leaf
out of the inevitable book of <i lang="fr">papiers poudrés</i>,
the silence that met me was quite as death-like
as if the girls had just been pulled up by Mr.
Dundonald’s “<em>Talk</em>-ing, ladies!”</p>

<p>Talking? I didn’t need to be told that,
<em>from</em> the moment they’d seen, out of the landing
window, the last of that taxi in which the
Governor and his private clerk had driven off,
<em>to</em> the moment they had heard my returning
footstep on the stairs, they had done nothing
<em>but</em> talk about me and my incredible, my epic
lunch.</p>

<p>As I drew the hat-pins from the admired new
hat, I prepared for a hurricane of comments and
questions.</p>

<p>None came. Not one of the girls seemed to
have a word to say to me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps they thought they would hear more
by seeming not too eager. (That’s rather Miss
Robinson’s style of “drawing out” her
companions.)</p>

<p>Perhaps they considered the subject too vast
for immediate discussion. Perhaps, for they
are all good-natured girls, they had come to the
conclusion that it wasn’t fair to “rag” me about
it—that I might be feeling too utterly nervous
and flurried over the unexpected (?) event.</p>

<p>They didn’t even ask me whether I had enjoyed
myself! I even saw them, distinctly,
avoid looking at me.</p>

<p>Only Miss Holt’s eyes seemed drawn, as if
in spite of herself, to the flowers I was taking
out of my coat to put in water in the grimy
jam-jar on the dressing-table that so often holds
Smithie’s bunch of violets; and it was Miss
Holt who breathed an involuntary—</p>

<p>“I say, what lovely carnations!”</p>

<p>“Do have some,” I said, as a matter of course,
dividing the cluster and holding out half to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I wouldn’t deprive you for the
world, Miss Trant,” murmured Miss Holt,
stiffly drawing back.</p>

<p>I realized from her tone that she considered
I had made a mistake.</p>

<p>Of course! Those flowers ought to have been
thought “too precious” to share with anybody.
Smithie would never think of giving one of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
“boy’s” violets away. Dear me, I thought,
what an added bore, having to remember to keep
up the correctly sentimental attitude about every
trifle of this kind.... <em>Ah!</em></p>

<p>I broke off what I was thinking at that moment
with quite a sudden start.</p>

<p>For, just as she turned away, I had caught
Miss Smith’s glance at that cluster of fresh,
crimson carnations. It might have been a bunch
of withered wall-flowers that had been left too
long in water, for the disgusted wrinkle that
lifted the prettiest typist’s small, powdered nose.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> wouldn’t touch them,” it seemed to say.</p>

<p>“Not <em>those</em> flowers.” ...</p>

<p>And at last I saw why.</p>

<p>The reason my three colleagues had forborne
to question, or chaff, or even look at me when I
came in from that expedition with the Governor
was <em>not</em> because they were too considerate,
too puzzled, or too wily.</p>

<p>It was merely because they were shocked—scandalized!</p>

<p>They were thinking worse things of me than
I thought I saw behind Lady Vandeleur’s
lifted lorgnette. I found myself suspected—probably
more than suspected!—of having run
counter to the standards of a class which is
perhaps more innately virtuous than Lady
Vandeleur’s and my own and Cicely’s, and
certainly more rigid in its judgments. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
remembered gossip about typists and their employers,
gossip from the days when I was taking
my training at Pitman’s. And out of this I
could imagine for myself the tone of the talk
about me that had passed across that marble-topped
table in the “Den of Lyons” at lunch-time.</p>

<p>“Well, Still Waters have been running deep,
with a vengeance! This is the meaning of her
taking down his letters for a whole fortnight—<em>without
any complaints</em>, girls! We might have
seen there was something funny in that!”</p>

<p>“She’s been pretty artful, too, not letting
on that there was anything at all, until to-day!—And
there must have been some sort of beginning.
A girl’s boss doesn’t take her out to
a swagger lunch, with flowers and a new hat and
all, without there’s been some sort of a leading
up to it!”</p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Robinson might suggest—“Well,
I should never have thought she’d been that
kind of girl. Fact of the matter is, I suppose
she funked losing her job if she didn’t.”</p>

<p>But Smithie and Miss Holt would chorus
vehemently, “She ought to have lost her job,
first! I would!—And chance it!”</p>

<p>Yes; according to this jury of maidens, I was
already pronounced “<i>Guilty</i>.”</p>

<p>And, innocent as I was of anything they
would have thought “mattered” in the least—for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
I don’t think the keeping-up of a false
engagement would have outraged their conventions
at all in comparison—I felt myself
turn hot and cold with shame over the false
position.</p>

<p>I was even thankful not to have to stay in
the same room with these other girls that afternoon—thankful
to be able to beat a retreat to
the large, light office where I took down letters
from the Governor’s rapid dictation as if my
whole life depended on it—thankful that he
did make such claims on the whole of my attention
and capabilities; thankful that the boring
“dinner-partner,” who had allowed a glimpse of
a slightly more human personality in the cab
when he’d discussed the difference between
frocks and furs, had been entirely swallowed up
again in the business-employer.</p>

<p class="tb">As he was leaving, he gave me the last of his
orders for the following day.</p>

<p>“I should be glad if you would have lunch with
me again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Waters.”</p>

<p>That means another ordeal in the dressing-room,
where the ill-ventilated atmosphere will
again be set simmering with the unspoken—and
the unspeakable. I never did think that this
ten pounds a week was going to be exactly easy
to earn. But I hadn’t bargained for this—This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
is outrageous! It makes me hate everybody:
Mr. Waters, to begin with, for making
the proposal; Jack next, for making it necessary
for me to accept it; the girls at the office here,
for so hideously misconstruing the position!</p>

<p>My ordinary work, which had for two or three
hours pushed my complicated “supernumerary
duties” to the back of my mind, has come to
an end, and the other thing looms well into the
foreground again. I’ve walked nearly all the
way back to Battersea, but that hasn’t worked
off my simmering indignation even yet.</p>

<p>I shall spend the evening ironing out washing-ribbon
and oddments in our tiny kitchen; I
can’t stay with Cicely—I should only snap at
her, and she would wonder why.</p>

<p>The one relief that I have been able to give
to my feelings was when, in crossing the bridge,
I tore those glorious crimson carnations (which
I wouldn’t leave at the Near Oriental!) out of
my coat again, and flung them far, far down into
the sluggish brown waters of the river below
me. How soon they were out of sight! How
I wish that I could put them and everything
connected with them, out of mind!</p>

<p class="tb">To-day, the day of my second lunch with Mr.
Waters, has been one that I don’t think I shall
ever forget, even when I’m a white-haired
maiden-lady, with no one to lunch with but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
a parrot or a tabby-cat, and no man’s “appointments”
to consult but those of the individual
who has to pay me over my Old Age Pension!</p>

<p>Silence—a silence that ought to have rejoiced
the heart of Mr. Dundonald, reigned throughout
the whole long morning. I knew that the girls
meant me to realize that Miss Trant, for outraging
the code of the self-respecting business-girl,
had been “sent to Coventry.”</p>

<p>This was what helped me to that stiffness of
spine, that Suffragette-like defiance of eye, and
that unnatural clearness of diction which I
felt myself assuming at one o’clock in the
dressing-room as I announced, “I think it is
at the Savoy that I am lunching with Mr.
Waters to-day.” For I flung it down like
a gauntlet.</p>

<p>It was Miss Robinson who accepted the
challenge with a particularly icy “Gracious!”</p>

<p>The two others stared hard; while Miss
Robinson, clearing her throat, fixed her shrewd
eyes on me and plucked up courage to add what
Smithie and Miss Holt were probably thinking.</p>

<p>“Miss Trant! D’you mind me asking you
if you’re going out with Mr. Waters because
you like it, or because you can’t say ‘No’?”</p>

<p>“Who would say ‘No’”—I fenced flippantly—“to
a Savoy lunch?”</p>

<p>“Some girls might,” murmured Miss Smith.
Miss Robinson, answering not my words, but my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
tone, said, “Of course it’s none of my business—except
that while you’re here you are supposed
to be one of us. And I can’t say——”</p>

<p>“Can’t say what?” I demanded, meeting
her shrewd eyes squarely with my defiant ones.
She flushed a little, and I was glad. But she
stuck to her guns.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that it looks any too well! A
man in his position, and a girl in yours! Under
those circumstances——”</p>

<p>“You know nothing,” I said, deliberately and
coldly, “about the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Still more deliberately I tossed a glance into
the inevitably soap-splashed mirror at the set
of my hat. Then, without another word, I
turned out of the open door and walked to the
lift, humming a tune just loud enough for them
all to hear.</p>

<p>This time I didn’t trouble to glance up from
the entrance, where my employer joined me, to
the landing window. The girls would not be
watching me off this time.</p>

<p class="tb">“Savoy!”</p>

<p>The taxi-driver touched his peaked cap with
a quite unusual suggestion of deference. I
suppose he had found Savoy luncheon-escorts
were generous tippers. I wondered if
he had ever before driven a couple in quite
these “circumstances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Miss Robinson’s sincerely-meant reproof, “<i>It
doesn’t look any too well! A girl in your position.
A man in his!</i>” echoed in my ears louder than
the whirring of the wheels and the noise of the
traffic. It rankled poisonously throughout the
drive, throughout the whole luncheon.</p>

<p>We lunched outside, which Mr. Waters said
laconically would be “more amusing for me
than inside.” Personally I felt that nothing
would ever amuse me less than this duty-lunch
with its hateful obbligato-accompaniment of
what those other girls were thinking, what they
were saying.</p>

<p>Oh, it’s all very well to quote that French
axiom—</p>

<p>“<i>They say—What do they say?—Let them
say!</i>” The average person will always find
that a counsel of perfection.—Especially the
average girl. The impulse <em>not</em> to let them
“say” if we can help it is nearly as strong in
us as the instinct of self-preservation, and of
touching our hair when we pass a mirror. So
that there must be some really important basic
reason for it. I do wish I knew what would
happen if that suddenly crumbled away ...?</p>

<p>But it isn’t “away” yet: it spoiled every
trace of amusement that I might otherwise
have enjoyed in the lunch and the people that
passed. I’ve merely a vague impression of cab-whistles,
of taxis whirling up beyond the trellis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of the low balustrade, of obviously American
figures appearing and disappearing among the
evergreens; of a small, unhappy-looking face
with dark eyes that stared resentfully at me out
of the bowls of spoons, and of a voice that said
half-absently, “I’m afraid you’ve made a very
poor lunch, Miss Trant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are tired?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not in the least, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Not too tired to come on somewhere? I
thought if you didn’t mind”—this always
preludes an order—“we’d drive to Gemmer’s
in Bond Street, and choose that ring for you.”</p>

<p>“Ring?” I repeated vaguely, as I put on my
gloves.</p>

<p>“You will have to have one, you know. An
engagement ring, as the outward and visible
sign of the new conditions,” he said nonchalantly,
as we rose. “Must have a ring to clinch the
effect!”</p>

<p>Yes, I thought resentfully, that “clinches”
it—for him. He doesn’t think of my side of
the affair at all! He doesn’t see that his
accurately mapped-out time-table includes any
unpleasantness—just because <em>he</em> doesn’t choose
to admit it!</p>

<p>I turned to him as we sat in the cab. I felt
like “the turning worm” as I pulled myself
together for what I meant to say.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHOOSING THE RING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“About that—engagement ring, Mr.
Waters——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You want me to take to wearing it, as soon
as you have got it, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” he said, turning a little
to look at me while I stared straight at the big
white-and-blue buses lumbering up the Strand,
but saw, clearer than the traffic, the faces of
Miss Robinson, Miss Holt, and Smithie wearing
that partly contemptuous, but more angry,
expression with which I suppose a decent Trades-Unionist
on strike might be entitled to look
down upon a blackleg. “Yes, of course it’s
for you to wear at once. What else?”</p>

<p>“And—to show the others?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” He looked still more surprised;
a little impatient, too. I suppose he
felt that again an irritating spoke was being
thrust into the well-oiled wheel of his plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“I am to show it to them and let them know,
in that way, that I am supposed to be engaged
to you?”</p>

<p>He answered this with another question.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Miss Trant, have you been having
any unpleasantness in the office about this—coming
out to lunch with me?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” I said. “Of course,” I added more
quickly, “it’s been awkward! You could not
expect it <em>not</em> to have been awkward—at least,
for me!”</p>

<p>“Ah? Made awkward for you by those
girls—what?”</p>

<p>“No! Oh, no!” I fibbed swiftly. For
again I could conclude his comment with that
relentless “<i>Well, then, they can go!</i>” And I
couldn’t have the girls sacked, calmly as I felt
I could have seen them all three strangled
an hour before. “Only—a little difficult to
explain.”</p>

<p>“This will explain it,” said my employer
coolly, as the taxi stopped outside the glass
door of the great jeweller’s. A page-boy in
green-and-silver swung it open for us. And
Mr. Waters made me precede him into the softly-carpeted
shop with the long glass counters and
the white velvet stands curved to the shape of
a woman’s neck, on which winked and flashed,
gleamed and glowed, diamonds—rubies—pearls—jewels
of every description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“The sight of flowers soothes and softens a
woman’s mood. Jewels, on the other hand,
stimulate, excite and irritate her. Possibly
because they generally signify longings unattainable
combined with the knowledge that, given
<em>that</em> necklace, or gems like those, or <em>such</em> a pair
of ear-rings, and any beauty she has would be
tenfold increased.” ... That is how Sydney
Vandeleur explained it to me. He’s interested
in jewels ever since he won that Arts and Crafts
competition for the design of a girdle in silver,
mother-o’-pearl, and peridot. And Cicely, of
the red curls, once confessed that she would
marry an octogenarian if he could give her a
really lovely rope of black pearls!</p>

<p>But that was in fun. This was business....</p>

<p>A small, olive-faced shopman in a frock-coat
and with curls like a retriever’s back bowed
over the counter and flashed his teeth at us.
Mentally I nicknamed him Mr. Levi Smarm.
It would have taken all Miss Robinson’s powers
of mimicry to reproduce the suavity of his
“Sir? What may I have the pleasure?”</p>

<p>“We want to see some rings,” said my
employer brusquely.</p>

<p>“Engagement rings, sir, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Waters, fixing a
cold granite-grey stare just above the retriever’s
back—or rather, the jeweller’s head.
“Now—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>I felt that he had nearly rapped out his usual
“Now, Miss Trant!” but checked himself
under the sympathetically intrusive eye of that
Jewish salesman as he turned to me—“what
stones do you prefer?”</p>

<p>“I? Oh! What does it matter?—I mean,
I don’t mind in the least!”</p>

<p>I was remembering things that various girl-friends
had told me, in the old days, of the
choosing of their engagement rings; of various
rings I had seen. One girl, whose <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>
had gipsy blood in his veins, had chosen a gipsy’s
silver wedding-ring. Another had a tiny enamel
circlet with the posy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>The Gift is Small</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>But Love is All.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If I <em>were</em> the falling-in-love type of girl, which
thank goodness I’m not, this scene at Gemmer’s,
so utterly opposed to all canons of Romance and
tradition, might have seemed a “desecration”—might
have got thoroughly on my nerves.</p>

<p>But what <em>was</em> on my nerves, which actually
were jangled enough for the moment, was—first,
the attitude of the girls towards me ever since I
came back from the Carlton yesterday—and,
secondly, the Governor’s blind tactlessness, his
intention of turning me loose among them, so
to speak, alone, to flaunt his ring on my finger!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>A positive rage against Still Waters boiled up
in me as suddenly as hot milk in the saucepan
when you don’t watch it. So, when he suggested,
casually, “Let us say diamonds, then, shall we?”
I heard myself retort quickly, almost before I
knew what I meant:</p>

<p>“Yes, diamonds. Diamonds are always money
afterwards, you know!”</p>

<p>As soon as it was out of my mouth I realized
that it was an appalling thing to say under any
circumstances. Mr. Levi Smarm, however,
seemed to consider it an extremely witty remark.</p>

<p>He threw back his curly head and laughed
quite pleasantly as he suggested that surely the
young lady was not thinking of an “afterwards”
already?</p>

<p>“It is always well to be provided for every
contingency,” put in Mr. Waters dryly. “I
should like to see those diamond rings in that
show-case over there, please.”</p>

<p>“There” was at the other end of the shop—which
meant that our salesman had to turn his
frock-coated back upon us, and that he was out
of earshot of the next remarks between his
“newly-engaged” customers.</p>

<p>“Miss Trant!”—the Governor spoke curtly
and hurriedly—“What was your meaning just
now when you said that ‘diamonds were always
money afterwards’?”</p>

<p>“Well—I—I understood that they were!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Perhaps I ought not to have said it with the man
there. I meant that you would not lose anything
on it when I return that ring to you in a
year’s time from now!”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about ‘returning’ the
ring when the so-called engagement is up?”
asked Mr. Waters, looking directly at me.</p>

<p>I was aghast.</p>

<p>“But ... naturally I send it back!”</p>

<p>“I had not intended that at all. You will
have ... expenses connected with this affair—railway-journeys,
and so on, I mean.” He
<em>meant</em> clothes again, I suspect, but could not
say so. “I intended whatever value the ring
might have to stand for those.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said, nearly boiling up again.
“In that case I won’t have diamonds, please.”</p>

<p>“This is a very pretty design, madam,” insinuated
the returning Mr. Smarm. “The
colour of these stones is very beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t think I’m going to have
diamonds,” I persisted, feeling quite amazed
at my own boldness. I meant, however, to carry
my point. “I’d rather have pearls—or opals——”</p>

<p>“Very seldom a young lady chooses opals for
her engagement ring,” smiled the shopman.
“That superstition against opals loses our firm
thousands of pounds’ business a year; the
majority of ladies considering them so unlucky.”</p>

<p>“I am not superstitious,” I said. “I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
like—I am going to have an opal ring, with very
small stones in it.”</p>

<p>“We are going to have diamonds,” remarked
my employer quietly. “Fetch me some other
diamond rings to look at.”</p>

<p>“I would rather not have them,” I urged,
in the temporary absence of the black curls and
white teeth.</p>

<p>“And I would rather that you had,” ordered
my employer. “After all, diamonds are the
show-stones; everybody notices them. They
look so unmistakably <em>like</em> an engagement, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I see,” I said reluctantly, my nerves
feeling more jangled than ever. “But, Mr.
Waters, if I must have them, I shall insist upon
sending back that ring when——”</p>

<p>“When the time comes we can discuss that,”
the Governor cut me short just as Mr. Levi
Smarm bent over us with his wave-offering of
jewels on a tray. “Yes. That’s a good one,
that big fellow with the stones going nearly all
round. Those seem a fine colour.”</p>

<p>“A perfect colour, sir; perfectly matched.
I am sure that you will——”</p>

<p>“Try it on,” said Mr. Waters, holding the
winking, flashing circlet out to me.</p>

<p>I pulled off my left-hand glove, but here the
suave shopman, evidently accustomed to shopping
couples who showed more appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of his sympathy and understanding, interposed
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, pardon me, sir, but that will never do.
That would be most incorrect! No young lady
would keep on an engagement ring that had
not been first slipped on to her finger by her
<i lang="fr">fiancé</i> himself!”</p>

<p>Mr. Waters’ glance of contempt at the shopman
would have shrivelled up the entire staff
at the Near Oriental. But several little things
had shown me already that the man who is a
Grand Mogul in his own offices can go down
several degrees in importance when he leaves
the City. Mr. Levi Smarm met that glance
with another flashing smile, and evidently
waited for us to take this last hint on bridal or
betrothal etiquette as it was meant.</p>

<p>I believe Mr. Waters was going to do so. A
slight shrug of his broad, sloping shoulders
seemed to say, “We may as well have everything
<i lang="fr">en règle</i> while we’re about it,” as he turned to
me. But I wasn’t going to have any masquerading
“frills” about this business that
could possibly be avoided, and this particular
development in our “romance” <em>was</em> avoidable.
I said very quickly and decidedly, “Oh, but I
don’t believe in anything of <em>that</em> sort, you know.”
Then quietly I took the ring, before he knew
what I was about, out of my employer’s hand, and
slipped it on to my own “wedding-finger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>There was a faint purple smudge off a new ribbon
on my knuckle just above the ring. I couldn’t
help thinking how entirely characteristic of the
whole affair this was: the stain of my daily
labour, showing side by side with these wonderful
stones—that must also be worn as part of
the gaining of my daily bread.</p>

<p>The ring fitted as if measured for me.</p>

<p>“You wish me to keep this?” I said briskly
to the Governor.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that one will do perfectly,”
he replied; and he turned to the young jeweller
again.</p>

<p>It was to ask the price, I knew. I was seized
with that ineradicable feeling of distress that
claims a woman under any circumstances whatsoever—when
mention is made of payment for
her, by another. She loves to be paid for—with
all thought of price ignored. So I rose and
turned to bend over another glass counter under
which gleamed pendants of pearls and emeralds—which
I scarcely saw, for another couple had
strayed into the shop—a plainish girl, simply and
rather dowdily dressed; a man like dozens of
others—and they interested me. Their two faces
were as radiant as if they had come into a fortune
sufficient to buy up the whole of Gemmer’s six
times over, but I heard the girl whisper, awe-struck
and ecstatic, “Oh, Harry, <em>no</em>! I <em>won’t</em>
let you! It’s <em>absurd</em>, for people like us.” ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“People like us aren’t going to be married
every day! Considering I nearly wrecked my
constitution and made myself unspeakably ill-tempered
by giving up smoking for eight months,”
growled the young man, “just to save up enough
to <em>be</em> absurd, you won’t catch me wasting it on
being <em>sensible</em>.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write you out the cheque now, and wait
while you ring up my bank, then,” the Governor’s
voice was saying; then came purrs from Mr.
Levi Smarm, of “Shall not detain you a moment,
sir ... Thank you, sir; perfectly all right.
Much obliged. <em>Good</em> afternoon, sir” (with a
bend to the waist). “Good <em>afternoon</em>, madam”
(with an even lower bend). Then he turned the
eyes and teeth and curls on the young couple
who had saved up to be “absurd.” I wondered
whether he would notice the difference
between them and—his last customers. Probably.
Ah, but he could hardly be expected to
know quite <em>what</em> it was!</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Mr. Waters, civilly, on our way
back to the office, “that that little Hebrew
bounder didn’t annoy you. That sort of thing
is all part of his business, you understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course I understand,” said I submissively.</p>

<p>“I am glad you—didn’t mind it,” said Mr.
Waters.</p>

<p>I longed to be able to retort, “<em>Mind?</em> Why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
on earth should I? Please try to understand
that there’s no reason I need ‘mind,’ any more
than one of those curved white velvet stands
at Gemmer’s should mind whose hand clasps and
unclasps the necklace of amethysts and peridots
that it displays. I’m quite content to let my
finger be a ‘stand,’ to show off these diamonds,
for which—for some unexplained reason—you’ve
got to pay someone to be the ‘official’ wearer!
All I ‘mind’ is the way you do these things—it’s
clumsy beyond belief!”</p>

<p>One comfort that remains to me is that I need
only wear this hateful ring of his while I <em>am</em> on
show—and not at other times.</p>

<p>No tightly-corseted Victorian has ever so
longed to be alone in her bedroom again and undo
her torturing case of whalebone and coutil as
I shall long to get away, every time I’m wearing
this “engagement” ring—to the mere pleasure
of taking it off!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ENGAGEMENT IS ANNOUNCED!</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Ten past three, by Jove; later than I
thought again,” muttered my employer
as we reached the office again. “And I’ve got
all those letters to get through yet.... Miss
Trant, I shall have to ask you to come straight
through to my room, please, and take these down
at once, as I’m off early this afternoon.”</p>

<p>So, still in my hat and coat, I walked straight
through to Mr. Waters’ own office, sat down at
the clerk’s table, and stripped off my gloves to
the afternoon’s work. (It’s alarming to see how
“twice-on” white gloves become impossible in
London. I’m afraid quite a lot of my hard-earned
ten pounds a week will go on those items
alone, now that I’m constrained to lunch at these
haunts of the well-dressed!)</p>

<p>All through the stress of following the
Governor’s top-speed dictation with my scurrying
shorthand, I was conscious of the bulge of that
newly-bought ring—heavy as a door-knob, it
seemed now!—on my engagement finger, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
shooting its arrogant glances of orange and
emerald and rose-colour over the dull pages of my
pad.</p>

<p>I was glad that it had not had to be displayed
at once in the dressing-room; glad of the
respite of my hour’s toil. But that seemed to
come to an end before I had even begun to set
my teeth, mentally, to the next ordeal.</p>

<p>—“<i>and beg to remain, gentlemen, yours, etc.</i>—Yes;
that’ll do, Miss Trant, thank you,” came
the Governor’s dismissal.</p>

<p>I put back my chair and stood up. Now for
it! Now for the announcement of this engagement!
I supposed that I need not <em>begin</em> by
saying a word to those three other girls. I should
only have to walk over to my typing-table, sit
down and open my machine, and the flash of
the electric light on those marvellous stones above
the keyboard would draw three pair of eyes upon
me at once. Should I have to answer that
clamouring gaze, or would the girls put it into
questions of so many words?</p>

<p>“Miss Trant?—Look, girls!—I say, tell us,
tell us? It’s not a joke? It’s an engagement
ring all right? You’re not trying to have us on,
now? Are you going to tell us——?”</p>

<p>Whichever way it happened, it was going to
be perfectly awful. Never mind. It had got
to be. It was part of the price of that five hundred
pounds, of Jack’s salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Miss Trant?” asked the
Governor, with a quick glance up at me as I
passed his chair.</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you. I am going to let the
others know, now, about this”—I moved that
detested ring on my hand into another challenging
flash. “And I suppose you will require
me to-morrow at lunch again?”</p>

<p>“No—yes—that is——About telling the others
of this engagement of ours,” took up Mr. Waters
unexpectedly. “Would you, by any chance,
prefer that I did that myself?”</p>

<p><em>Would</em> I? I nearly gasped with relief! Why
couldn’t he have seen before what a difference
this would make to the situation? There isn’t
much dignity in it, goodness knows. But this
would save some appearance of it, at all events!
I said quietly, “If it is the same to you, I
certainly should prefer it.”</p>

<p>“Then please wait here while I see them.
I won’t keep you a moment,” said Still Waters,
and he walked quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>It seemed an hour to me, but I suppose the
minute-hand of the round-topped clock on the
broad marble mantelpiece had only moved on
two steps before the door opened again to admit
my employer.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he told me, with his succinct
nod. “I have announced the ‘engagement’
to the three other typists, and shall let Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Dundonald and Mr. Alexander know before I
leave. I won’t keep you, Miss Trant. Good
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” I said. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I really felt like
thanking him. And yet he’d only done the
most ordinary thing that one would expect
the most ordinary man to take as a matter
of course. Only the custom-honoured practice
of the Near Oriental is to refuse to regard its
head as an ordinary man. Of course, he <em>isn’t</em>.
There are advantages in making a presupposition
of this kind, perfectly clear from the
very start!</p>

<p>Feeling comparatively at ease and my own
mistress again, I entered the typists’ room with
my head as high as it had been when I marched
out to the lift at lunch-time after Miss Robinson’s
voicing of what they all thought of me.</p>

<p>Miss Robinson, with her shrewd face startled
into the likeness of someone much younger and
less astute, broke away from the other two—they
had been all three chattering and knotted
up together in the corner by the cupboard where
the tea-things are kept—and came frankly towards
me.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Trant! <em>Here’s</em> some news we’ve
just had sprung on us,” said she, speaking as if
she found great difficulty in sorting out her
words. “I must say—well, really! Gracious!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Are you going to shake hands and let us congratulate
you, as I suppose is the right thing, or
are you feeling wild with me about this morning?
We didn’t know, you know. We never
dreamed——! How was anyone to guess, after
all——!”</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t,” I said, shaking hands
with one after the other. “And of course I’m
not feeling ‘wild!’” My revenge was to
hand if I wanted it. But somehow I didn’t
feel it would be worth it, now. Though, as a
matter of fact, the reminder of what I had felt
that morning had brought some of it surging
back over me again. And this feeling was not
improved by the wording of little Miss Holt’s
felicitations.</p>

<p>“‘Wild?’ I should think Miss Trant was
ready to pat herself on the back for the next week,
eh? Who’d ’a thought of this, that day we were
all trying to buck her up at lunch when she was
afraid she was going to get the sack? Didn’t I
say then, though, that Miss Trant would do all
right because she’d got a taking way with men?
But—the Governor himself—that we never did
look upon as just a ‘man!’ Well, you never
can tell!”</p>

<p>“I shall never try to, after <em>this</em> afternoon,”
announced Miss Robinson. “Not after his
marching in at that door there, and saying, in
quite a human sort of voice—not his own voice at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
all—that is, you’ll excuse me, Miss Trant! You
know what I mean!—saying, ‘<i>I have some news
to tell you ladies. Miss Trant and I are engaged
to be married!</i>’”</p>

<p>“Married to the head of the firm—my hat!”
breathed Miss Holt, devouring me with her eyes,
as if she thought that by staring hard enough
she might discover the secret of how one achieved
this giddy height. “Too grand to speak to any
of us after this! Look at that ring of hers!
Think of all <em>that</em> means!”—</p>

<p>Yes! If she only could!</p>

<p>—“No more turning out to get to business every
morning, wet or dry, with the mud still stiff on
your skirt that you haven’t had time to brush!
No more lining up with the crowd to wait for
that beastly old workman’s tram at the ‘Elephant!’
No more strap-hanging! No more
packed motor-buses with flower-women, and
goodness knows what, shoving their baskets into
you and trampling on your feet as they get in!”
She took breath, and then, for fear one of the
others should interrupt before she finished this
harangue upon the Dignity of Labour, she hurried
on—“No more having to keep on at it if you <em>are</em>
ready to drop and your eyes popping out of your
head—no more A.B.C. girls not taking the
slightest notice of your order and <em>then</em> giving you
sauce because you’ve waited half an hour for
your lunch—no more slaving from har’-past nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
to six for <em>her</em> any more!... I suppose you
know you’re <em>most awfully lucky</em>?”</p>

<p>“In some ways,” murmured Miss Smith softly.
“But having stacks of money and never having
to work again isn’t <em>everything</em>!”</p>

<p>And the dreamy look that came into her eyes
irritated me worse than the loudly-expressed
envy of the other girl. Miss Holt’s type of mind,
that cares only for the things that she can see
and handle and wear and eat and drink, <em>is</em> so
much easier to tackle than an <em>un</em>-practical person’s
point of view. I’m glad I’m rather like Miss
Holt, myself. These sentimental people are
too tiresome!</p>

<p>I simply couldn’t help one snap at Miss Smith
as I turned to her.</p>

<p>“I suppose <em>nothing’s</em> ‘everything’ except
wasting <em>years</em> waiting for Love in a flat? I
suppose you despise any hard-up girl who’s
sick of the struggle and who marries for comfort
and a home?”</p>

<p>“I don’t despise anybody, Miss Trant, as it
happens!” protested Smithie, facing me with
the sudden defiance of a mild nature touched
in its tenderest spot. “<em>You</em> didn’t ought to
speak sarcastically to me, just because <em>you</em> can
get married at once instead of waiting—years—till
he can afford——”</p>

<p>“Well, and you needn’t despise me for that
other reason, at all events,” I said, a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
mollified by the tears that were now welling up
in the dreamy eyes, “for, whatever else I may be
going to do, Miss Smith, I am not going to
marry Mr. Waters for his money!”</p>

<p>I didn’t add that I shouldn’t ever marry him
at all, but that his money was quite good enough
to get engaged to him on. However, had I
openly announced this, I don’t think she could
have looked more surprised.</p>

<p>“Not for his money—marry him for <em>love</em>,
then? <em>Him?</em>” screamed little Miss Holt before
she could stop herself. Then she clapped her
hand over her wide-open mouth, another involuntary
gesture, caused partly, I suppose, by
the impulse to keep back anything further that
might offend me, and partly by the appearance
at the door of Mr. Dundonald.</p>

<p>It was to everybody’s amazement that this
was not immediately followed by the inevitable
“<em>Talk</em>-ing, ladies!” and the scowl.</p>

<p>But an extensive smile creased Mr. Dundonald’s
shut fist of a face into unfamiliar lines
of benevolence; he beamed upon us all as he
announced in a voice as suavely unfamiliar as the
smile, “Miss Trant! I am sorry to interrupt
your conversation, but Mr. Waters would be
much obliged if you would go back to his room
again for a moment, as he wishes to say a few
words to you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” I said, wondering what in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the world this additional “order” might be.
The girls didn’t “wonder.” I know they
thought it was for another good-bye—especially
Smithie, one-idea’d simpleton! I felt her
demure little smile in the small of my back as I
turned to the door. Mr. Dundonald—oh, unprecedented
occurrence!—held it open for me,
murmuring, as I passed out, “Miss Trant!
May I be permitted to proffer my very heartiest
good wishes on the occasion of this—this delightful
announcement?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Thank you so much,” I said pleasantly.
(“Worm!” I thought.)</p>

<p>So the Governor had told Mr. Dundonald
while I was receiving the congratulations of
my colleagues....</p>

<p>I saw in his eye—grey, fishy, and always looking
as if “the Main Chance” were plainly
visible just ahead of any person he addressed—that
already my personality had changed from
that of the twenty-five-shillings-a-week typist,
clad in her “all-I’ve-got” serge costume and
liable to dismissal at his hands, to that of young
Mrs. William Waters, who, gorgeous in silk,
satin and sables, would one of these days be
calling at the office to pick up the head of the
firm and to motor him home with her! Mr.
Dundonald’s new manner was a forecast of his
reception of me when that day should dawn!</p>

<p>If <em>he</em> only knew!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Sorry to trouble you again,” said the
Governor as I presented myself before him once
more. “I forgot, in the middle of all that
other business”—this, I suppose, might have
applied to either the dictating of his letters, or
the choosing of his betrothal ring—“to tell
you that I intend to let my mother know, to-night,
about this engagement of ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“You will probably hear from her to-morrow,
inviting you to stay at our house—it’s near
Sevenoaks. You had better send in your formal
resignation to the office at once, and make
your arrangements to come on for a fortnight’s
visit or so, in a few days. Will that be convenient
to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly,” I said obediently, hoping
that I did not show any outward symptoms of
that sick feeling of panic that possessed me. To
stay at the Governor’s house? So soon?
Horrors! With the Governor’s mother? What
<em>will</em> she be like? Exactly like him, probably,
only far more forbidding; women can always
be more alarming than even the most terrifying
of men. An elderly feminine edition of Still
Waters! Ye gods! And she will hate me,
of course; look upon me as that designing
minx of a typist who had “got round” her son
in business-hours and prevented him from
“doing well for himself” in some other direction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
People with money always want their children
to marry people with more! It will be Lady
Vandeleur over again, only worse. How appalling!
Perhaps she will make herself as disagreeable
to me as possible, in the hope of
inducing me to feel that I should never be able
to stand such a mother-in-law, and that I should
simply have to break it off!—which, under the
circumstances, I’m powerless to do!</p>

<p>“And—er—that will be all, this afternoon,
thank you. You will hand your notes of my
letters to Mr. Alexander. If you have arrangements
to make, you can leave as early as you
choose to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Waters.”</p>

<p>Feeling that I couldn’t have stood another
minute of him and his “arrangements,” I
walked quickly out of the room and down the
passage.</p>

<p>Round a corner, I heard the voice of our office
mimic, who had slipped out on some pretext,
in full flow of narrating to one of the telephone
girls the amazing news that I know was being
buzzed all over the Near Oriental offices.</p>

<p>—“but, my dear, the little Trant gives out
she’s madly in love with him! She says”—here
a most successful imitation of my own
voice—“‘Whatever else I may be doing, I
am NOT marrying him for his money!’”</p>

<p>“P’raps it’s for his kind heart and his charm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
of manner, I don’t think,” suggested the telephone
girl. “Or his good looks, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing actually the matter with his looks,
my girl. Anyhow, he does always look as if he
went in for no end of cold water, and week-end
tramps, and golf, and the windows wide open,
and decent soap—cuticura, I’ve smelt it,” said
Miss Robinson. “And as if he could <em>heave</em>
things—which nobody else does, in this establishment.
And if you <em>can</em> get over the general
effect of ‘the stern-and-solemn-Nelson’s
column——’”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t. But she’s quite pretty if
she’d only make a little more <em>of</em> herself; p’raps
she will now,” said the telephone girl, who
wears long coral drop-earrings and pins brown-paper
cuffs over her sleeves in business-hours.
“What on earth do you suppose he said when
he proposed to her?”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Now, Miss Trant, when you have taken
down that Buenos Ayres order, there is something
I have to consult you about personally. Now, Miss
Trant, are you prepared to consider</i>——’”</p>

<p>It was so exactly our employer’s voice that I,
standing there unnoticed, burst out laughing.
The girls, caught out, laughed too.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know you were the talk of the
place, did you, Miss Trant? May as well make
up your mind to it,” said Miss Robinson. “And
do show Miss Harris your ring!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“I could see it from here. I thought it was
something being done to the electric lights.
My! but they are sparklers! I shouldn’t half
swank, wearing jewellery like this. Did you
choose it to-day, Miss Trant? My word!
Some people do have all the luck. It’ll be a
very short engagement, I presume?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said I, thinking of the
nearly twelve complicated and weary months
that stretched before me. “Some time yet.”</p>

<p>“No doubt any time’ll seem long <em>na-ow</em>,” said
the telephone girl archly. “Can’t you tell
us <em>about</em> when it’s likely to be?”</p>

<p>Oh, dear! It seemed to me as if I passed
through hours of this sort of thing before I
could break away and set out for Battersea and
our bachelor-girl flat.</p>

<p>Wearily, and without any “spring” left in
me, I climbed the four flights of stone steps.
I felt positively dragged down by the thought
of that awful fortnight with the Governor’s
mother at their house near Sevenoaks. It had
clung to me all the way back. Only as I put my
key into the door did I remember something
else.</p>

<p>There would be Cicely to break the news of
my engagement to, now!</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LOVER WHO CAME TOO LATE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>But here, in our flat, I found to my amazement
that someone had been before me
with the news.</p>

<p>Cicely’s marigold-coloured hair and flushed
face reared themselves up excitedly from the
faded couch cushions as I came in.</p>

<p>“I say! <em>Tots!</em> What’s all this?—Look here,
what <em>is</em> the meaning of it?” she cried breathlessly.
“What’s this wild story about you
being engaged to be married? Do say it isn’t
true;—it can’t be! is it?”</p>

<p>“Who in the world,” I demanded, standing
by our rickety old table in the middle of the
room and staring at her as she sat up leaning
on her elbow, “told you anything about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, who d’you suppose? Who would?”</p>

<p>I glanced quickly at the tray on the table,
crowded with the <i lang="fr">débris</i> of what had been tea
for two, one saucer piled high with cigarette-ends
that told their own tale. Who had
been? One of Cicely’s Slade girls? But how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
would <em>they</em> know? Whoever it was must have
stayed <em>hours</em>!</p>

<p>“It was your friend”—Cicely announced this
even as the cork hurls itself from an unwired
bottle of champagne—“Mr. Sydney Vandeleur!”</p>

<p>“Sydney—he’s been here?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course!”</p>

<p>“What on earth for?”</p>

<p>“What <em>for</em>, Tots? Why, to see <em>you</em>! And,
I say! How awfully charming and clever and
delightful he is! And so handsome! Such
a real artist’s head, I call it! <em>Exactly</em> like a
Vandyke of Charles the First! Oh, my dear!
<em>Don’t</em> tell me you’ve gone and got engaged to
somebody else, when there’s such a really <em>wonderful</em>
person so desperately in love with you!”</p>

<p>“Who says he’s in love with me?”</p>

<p>“Why, he does, of course. Didn’t you
<em>know</em>? You must have. <em>Didn’t</em> you?”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>Slowly I dropped my gloves and umbrella
and vanity-bag and paper on to the table. Of
course I have “known,” at the back of my mind,
all the time about Sydney. But however
positive a girl may be that a man cares for her,
<em>until he’s told her so she’s never certain</em>. This
may sound Irish—to a man. Any <em>girl</em> understands....</p>

<p>To hear the fact proclaimed by Cicely’s lips—which
really, I do believe, would blurt out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
anything that came into her red head!—gave me
the same shock of surprise that it would have done
even if I’d never received little attentions from
Sydney, never heard his neatly-turned compliments,
never seen those handsome brown eyes of
his fixed upon me in unmistakable admiration,
or noticed the blank mask that had suddenly
fallen over them yesterday, when I broke to the
Vandeleurs the news of my so-called engagement.
Cicely went on with her tale, enjoying
it thoroughly.</p>

<p>“My dear Tots, you must have known.
He’s wanted to marry you ever since you were
a slip of a schoolgirl with a little proud pearl of
a face and that lovely dark hair of yours in a
great mane down to your waist. Even then he
always meant to propose to you.”</p>

<p>“And he tells <em>you</em> that? Not me?”</p>

<p>Here I sat down suddenly in the elbow-chair
with the one arm “that’s always a-comin’ off,
drat it!” as Mrs. Skinner says.</p>

<p>It came off now.</p>

<p>“<em>Drat</em> it!” I quoted, through my teeth, and
hurled the broken arm into a corner with a
violence that did some—not much—good to
my feelings. “He never told me, Cicely.”</p>

<p>“Because he was too tactful, too nice. He’d
too much fine feeling,” she explained eagerly.
“He couldn’t possibly ask you so soon after the
‘smash’ in your affairs, and after Colonel Trant’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
death, and all. It <em>would</em> have looked too much
as if he were taking advantage of that to rush
the position. He determined to wait until you—until
he—well, to wait,” said Cicely. “He
saw I was sympathetic; he didn’t mind telling
me all this. But he was going to ask you when
he and his mother came back from abroad. All
the time, he was simply longing to come and carry
you off bodily from that hateful typewriter
where he kept thinking of you chained, he said,
like Andromeda (who <em>was</em> she, exactly?) to her
rock. Only he just wouldn’t. Wasn’t it <em>sweet</em>
of him, Tots!”</p>

<p>“To wait and tell all this to another girl?”</p>

<p>“But it was you he was coming round to tell!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t stop to see me.”</p>

<p>“He <em>had</em> to get back to Belgrave Square and
dress for a theatre-party of his mother’s.”</p>

<p>“What he came for at all, after yesterday, I
don’t see!”</p>

<p>“It was <em>about</em> yesterday he came to see you,
Tots! You see, he says he met you, and you
seem to have made him understand that you were
engaged to be married.”</p>

<p>“Well? Didn’t he believe me? Did he
come round here and sit here filling the place
with that abominable reek of Egyptian cigarettes—and,
yes! finishing <em>all</em> that nice peach jelly I
got in specially for you—to find out whether it
was true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Is it true, then?” gasped Cicely.</p>

<p>“<em>Yes!</em> I told him so. I told Lady Vandeleur
so. I am engaged.”</p>

<p>“And not—to <em>him</em>!” Cicely seemed utterly
unable to grasp how this could be. “What?
After all he’s said—and <em>with</em> his photograph on
your dressing-table—not that it’s nearly good
enough for him! And after what I told him I
hoped——”</p>

<p>“What DID you tell him?” I groaned
resignedly.</p>

<p>Cicely twisted the long, slender figure, upon
which her equally slender salary as a mannequin
depends, into a more comfortable curve against
the cushions.</p>

<p>“Well! <em>Poor</em> Mr. Vandeleur! When he
said he’d seen you lunching at the Carlton
alone with a young man, I told him it must be a
mistake. You never <em>did</em> lunch there, or with
young men. It was just what I admired you
for, when it’s <em>so</em> easy to get into the other way
of being rather nice to people just for the sake of
their giving you a good time and a change from
being at work all day! And even though you’re
not a bit stuffy with me because I sometimes
do it, you——”</p>

<p>“Never mind me. What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said: ‘But how <em>could</em> there be a mistake?
She brought up this self-satisfied-looking
individual and introduced him to my mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
as her <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>. She let us congratulate him!’
I said, ‘Well, but she hasn’t <em>got</em> a <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>—or I
should have known about it! I’ve never heard
a syllable. She didn’t even tell me she was going
out to lunch. She must have been taken out at a
moment’s notice—by a friend of Jack Trant’s,
perhaps. Or,’ I said, ‘it may have been someone
she absolutely had to meet, on business!’” she
continued vaguely—much she knows about business!—“‘Getting
a better post, or something
of that sort. And when she met you unexpectedly,
she was flurried, and didn’t know how to
explain. Is your mother rather particular, or
strait-laced?’ Mr. Vandeleur said, ‘Very,
I am afraid!’ So I said, ‘Well, that’s what must
have happened!—Tots, in her nervousness, and
not wishing your mother to be shocked, just
blurted out ‘<i lang="fr">fiancé</i>’——”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I muttered. “I didn’t know
<em>I</em> was a blurter-out!”</p>

<p>“You mean <em>I</em> am! I daresay! Well, I
don’t care! I thought that <em>must</em> have been
it—I didn’t see what else it could have been!
And the poor man was so thirsting to hear
anything I could tell him about you, that I
should have been a brute not to!” declared
my chum, plaintively defiant. “So I just said
everything I could—about that photograph,
and all!”</p>

<p>“What photograph?” I snapped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Why, that one of Mr. Vandeleur. I recognized
him from that, the moment Mrs. Skinner
let him in. And I told him that it was the one
and only portrait of a young man that you seemed
to possess, and that you always keep it in a silver
frame beside your looking-glass. Now, Tots,
you can’t say you don’t!”</p>

<p>No; I couldn’t.</p>

<p>“And that cheered him up so, poor fellow!
He said—Oh, <em>isn’t</em> it a tragedy?” interpolated
Cicely with zest—“that I’d given him fresh
hope to go away with!”</p>

<p>“Fresh fiddlesticks,” I muttered, still more
savagely.</p>

<p>“You mean there isn’t any?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” I explained as patiently as I could,
“that a girl can’t be engaged to two men at
once.”</p>

<p>“Then <em>who’s</em> this other, Tots, that you’ve never
said a word about? He can’t possibly be fit to
hold a candle to—I mean, who <em>is</em> it?”</p>

<p>“It is the managing director and head of the
firm where I’ve been working,” I told her
bluntly. “His name is Mr. William Waters.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> Not the man you all call ‘<i>Still
Waters</i>’? The one you all detest, who’s so
impossible to please? Engaged to him? Oh,
now you’re pretending! Tell me, Tots. Of
course you are only joking, after all?”</p>

<p>A nice idea of “joking” my chum has got!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Does</em> this look like a joke?” I demanded
suddenly. The newly-bought diamonds flashed
under her widely-opened eyes. “Don’t you
admire my engagement ring, Cis?”</p>

<p>Cicely Harradine’s soft bud of a face faded
from pink to pale, and her big eyes clouded dolefully.
She said nothing for a moment but “Oh,
Tots!” (she’s quite as hopeless as Miss Smith).
Then, in a tone of the timidest reproach, she
faltered, “Mr. Vandeleur <em>said</em> he was ‘big and
blonde and City-fied and extremely prosperous-looking.’
I said I’d never seen any friend of
yours who was like that. No wonder! The head
of the firm! But—Tots!—I should—should
hate to think of you, of all girls, marrying anyone
because of his—money?”</p>

<p>“Then don’t think it. You may do me that
justice!” I said sharply. She was nearly as
bad in her way as the typists at the Near
Oriental had been in theirs—and the same prevarication
had to be used to “head off” <em>her</em>
comments on a marriage for money. After which,
the accusation in my chum’s big eyes melted
suddenly into tears. Impulsively she flung her
slim arms round my neck—and I had to let her.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Tots. Dear old girl, but how
<em>was</em> I to know? It’s all so unexpected, and I
never met him, and you never gave me a hint!
I <em>didn’t</em> see how you could possibly prefer anyone
to Mr. Vandeleur, who <em>is</em> so wonderful! But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of course I know Love’s blind—I mean, you
can’t <em>make</em> yourself not care for this Mr. Waters,
just because another man wants so badly to
marry you! Oh, Tots, it’s all my fault, but I’m
afraid he’s going to write to you about that——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vandeleur is?” (This, too!)</p>

<p>“Yes! It’s all because of what I said to him.
I have been putting my foot in it,” she admitted,
as if this were quite a new idea to me too, “but
<em>do</em> forgive me—Since you do really care for this
Mr. Waters I’m only too delighted, darling. Oh,
I’m so glad for your happiness, you can’t think!
When did it happen? He’s <em>madly</em> in love with
you, of course?”</p>

<p>Here I thought grimly of Miss Robinson’s
version: “<i>My dears, the little Trant makes out
she’s madly in love with him!</i>” All this about
two people who, as far as I can make out, have
only one thing in common—both being absolutely
falling-in-love-<em>proof</em>!</p>

<p>Poor, well-meaning, warm-hearted Cicely was
still effusing; eager to make up for her first
suspicion that I <em>wasn’t</em> engaged for the only
right reason.</p>

<p>“I ought to have seen! Of course! It was
he who gave you this extra work about a fortnight
ago?”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” (Extra work with a vengeance!
More than I’ve bargained for!)</p>

<p>—“And that we were so thankful for, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
when I lost my own job and was ill, and there
were all those extra things to get.... It was
your ‘rise’ that got them all, I knew. Only I
didn’t know ... this other. It <em>began</em> then, I
suppose, Tots?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it began then.”</p>

<p>“How romantic! Well! And I did notice
that you’ve been absent-minded and not saying
much these last few days, and I <em>ought</em> to have
known why it was. <em>Especially</em> yesterday. Did
HE take you out to lunch again to-day? Oh,
doesn’t it make the whole world different for
you?”</p>

<p>“It makes the menu jolly different, anyhow,”
I admitted.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; you may pretend to be as flippant
as you like about it, but I know that’s ‘all put
on’ to hide what you’re really feeling!” declared
Cicely.</p>

<p>Such a convenient conviction! I made up my
mind, then and there, that this was just the line
I should adopt with my chum. And laughing
merrily for her benefit, I fled to my own little
room.</p>

<p class="tb">Here, left to my own thoughts at last, I
flung myself down on my creaky little camp
bedstead and raged as I reviewed this new
aspect of the situation. Put crudely, it is this:
It’s not <em>until</em> I tie myself up with this wretched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
sham “engagement” to the Governor that I
have the chance of cutting everything to do
with him and his odious office, and becoming
safely, happily and <em>genuinely</em> engaged!</p>

<p>Or, in the jargon of the Near Oriental, it’s
just after I’ve sold out at a loss that I get an
advantageous offer!</p>

<p>Why on earth couldn’t Sydney Vandeleur
have said all that <em>before</em>? A year ago—even a
month ago—and, to <em>think</em> what it would have
saved! I shouldn’t have minded getting that
money for Jack—from his own brother-in-law!
Yes; if he’s cared for me all this time, why
couldn’t he have proposed to and married me
before I’d so much as seen that hateful Near
Oriental, with that “Andromeda’s rock” of a
typewriter, watched over by what Miss Holt
calls “that Gordian” of a Governor! Why
couldn’t Sydney have hurried up, for once in his
life, to play Perseus?</p>

<p>“Too much tact!” Good gracious! Why
must men have this absurd code of ethics about
“the right thing” when there’s a <em>woman</em> in
the case? Why does a man who’s hard-up,
for instance, consider it so much more “honourable”
to “ride away” without a word to the
girl whose heart he knows is his, just because he
“feels he oughtn’t to propose before he’s in a
position to marry?”</p>

<p>He “feels he ought not to stand in the girl’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
way of better offers.” ... But he <em>does</em> that,
more often than not, with her first sight of him!
Never mind. He’d <em>rather</em> leave her fretting her
heart out for life over the belief that he was only
flirting after all, or let her make a miserable
marriage with someone else—rather than be
“dishonourable” enough to own up that he
cares and wants her to wait perhaps three or four
years for him. He’s saved his precious “code,”
just as I suppose Sydney wished to save his.</p>

<p>Oh, men’s “fine feelings,” men’s delicacy
and tact, men’s sense of honour! What infinitely
greater damage these do in the world
than all women’s lack of principle!</p>

<p>That sounds sweeping, but <em>isn’t</em> this enough
to make a girl storm at the scruples—or whatever
they may call them—which have pretty well
messed up her own life for her?</p>

<p>I ought to be safely and happily married, by
now, to Sydney Vandeleur. He’d make a
charming husband, I know; not a wish of his
wife’s that he wouldn’t immediately try to
gratify, from the pattern of the drawing-room
carpets to where she would wish to live most
of the time—Pont Street—Park Lane—or the
perfectly gorgeous, old-fashioned castle with all
modern conveniences that he owns in Ireland—Ballycool,
they call it. Oh, for the deep
sighing woods and the silver lakes over there—miles
and miles from anywhere else—scented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
solitude, with all the drawbacks of solitude
removed by motors <i lang="la">ad lib.</i>—by big house-parties
of amusing people as often as one chose!—Yes,
I suppose I do share Miss Holt’s type of
mind, but then I never pretend to be romantic,
or to cherish illusions about being able to fall
in love.... I should be really, genuinely fond
of Sydney himself—I mean I <em>should</em> have been.
He’d be so devoted—how could one help feeling
pleased to have him about, approving of everything
one did and said and looked? He’s what
I’d call companionable; not too lofty and
masculine to take an interest in the details that
mean so much more to a woman than what this
country is coming to, by Gad, or what on earth
McKenna or Asquith or someone is driving at
when he says—(here yards, droned aloud, out
of the <cite>Times</cite>)—or whether Kent is going to do
any better this year; which is all the conversation
that any married women <em>I’ve</em> ever met
seem to get out of <em>their</em> husbands. Sydney
would always know what anyone had had on at
a party, including his wife. He’d be able to
help her think out her frocks—and what
heavenly frocks they would be! Then he’s so
undeniably good-looking himself. One wouldn’t
be able to help appreciating the fact that the
other women would always notice it with envy,
and would put it down as such a score to the
credit of the one he’d married! His dark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
“interesting” face with the Vandyke beard
and the melancholy brown eyes seems watching
me now out of the big silver frame in which he
sent it to me. Yes; it certainly does hold the
place of honour on the narrow painted-pine
chest-of-drawers that has two handles missing,
but is still spread with ivory-topped brushes,
a monogrammed hand-mirror and long crystal
scent flagons—relics from the wreck of the
Trant fortunes!—the place of honour usually
reserved in a girl’s room for the portrait of
HIM—whoever “he” may be! Why did I
put it there? Partly for the sake of old times,
I suppose; I’ve tried to keep everything of that
sort which was in my room at home....
Partly to remind myself, whenever I’ve felt
extra-downhearted, that there was at least one
eminently presentable young man who was
accustomed to say pretty things of the face and
hair that I saw reflected in the somewhat wavy
looking-glass near by.... Sentiment, vanity,
or a mixture of both, but <em>not</em> the motive with
which Cicely had credited me and which she’d
seen fit to impart to the original.</p>

<p>That idiot of a Sydney! If I could hope
he’d feel it, I’d smash the glass of that frame
and run red-hot hat-pins into his portrait.
I have been furiously angry to-day, in turns
with the three typists, with Still Waters, and
with Cicely—but none of this counts, compared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
with my fury against the lover who has come
too late!</p>

<p>It’s his fault. It’s all his fault—all that’s
just happened—all that will happen during the
mad “arrangement” of this next year. And
when that year’s up, where will it find me?
A little richer, perhaps, by what’s left of my
desperately-won salary, but back in the over-crowded
labour-market, the world of working-women
who lose looks and youth and spirits in
the struggle for daily bread. Oh, it’s all very
well to be plucky, and to treat everything as
a joke, and to live from one Saturday matinée
to another, making the most of life in London
as a bachelor-girl—while you’re twenty-one.</p>

<p>What becomes of the “bachelor-girl” of
forty-five? And fifty?</p>

<p>That, I suppose, I shall have to wait and
find out for myself, thanks to Mr. Sydney
Vandeleur!</p>

<p>Why couldn’t he have left things as they were
at the Carlton?—</p>

<p>But I’ve had enough of this. It has “done
me up” completely.</p>

<p>I am going to bed.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>This morning I feel, if anything, angrier with
Sydney Vandeleur than I did before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>He’s done it now! He <em>has</em> written.</p>

<p>His note lies before me on our wobbly little
breakfast-table with the metal coffee-pot and
the green Bruges crock full of lilac (bought out
of my “rise”!) screening me from Cicely’s
anxious eyes as I read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>My dearest Monica</i>,</p>

<p>“<i>I have never called you so before. That
was a mistake. Anything is a mistake that keeps

<p>“<i>Let me come on Monday afternoon, and,

<span class="smaller">“HIS” MOTHER’S INVITATION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The note of invitation from “my <i lang="fr">fiancé’s</i>
mother” is purely formal and absolutely
non-committal; in fact, exactly the note I
should have imagined that a Mrs. Waters would
write.</p>

<p>I’ve got a perfectly clear mental image of
this mother of an animated tape-machine.
Handsome, in a regular-profiled, stately, mid-Victorian
style, with steely grey eyes that “corkscrew”
all the self-possession out of you, and—oh,
the manner! She won’t be openly disagreeable
after all, I’ve decided. Worse; she’ll be
rigidly, frigidly polite; clothing in irreproachable
civilities the obvious wonder whether
her son has taken leave of his senses, to propose
to one of his own employees.</p>

<p>She writes that she looks forward (of course!)
with pleasure (<em>dis</em>-pleasure, she means) to making
my acquaintance (<em>will</em> she!) at The Lawn
(well, I suppose they can’t <em>call</em> their house The
Sarcophagus. But that’s what it ought to be.
A glorified edition of the Governor’s private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
office. Marble halls and chilly statuary—brr!)
on Monday next. I expect she guesses that
“this Miss Trant,” or “that young woman,”
or “the horrid little typist-person,” or whatever
she calls me in her own mind, will be rather
overwhelmed by the prospect; and no doubt
Mrs. Waters means to see that I shall continue
being overwhelmed—“kept in my place,”
indeed—during the whole of the fortnight that
the Governor specified. But she can’t realize
the positive panic with which I anticipate the
meeting. And, if I can steel myself to help
it, she <em>shall not</em> realize it.</p>

<p>“I should think you can hardly wait until
you get there, Tots,” said Cicely, watching me
pack new clothes in the new dress-basket bought
specially for the dread occasion, for I’ve spent
every minute of two days in shopping. “Aren’t
you <em>dying</em> to see what everything is going to
be like?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to survive until to-morrow,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“‘His’ home! His father’s dead, you said.
Is there only his mother?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Quite enough too. <em>I</em> think
all engaged men ought to be orphans and only
children before they begin, for the sake of the
girl. ‘Only’ his mother, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s <em>bound</em> to be pleased with you,
Tots! You’re so pretty and ripping, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
now you’ve got all these lovely new things.
What a mercy that you had that little windfall
of a legacy just in time to let you buy all fresh!”</p>

<p>(This is how I’ve been obliged to account for
that.)</p>

<p>“You could go and stay anywhere now, meet
anybody! He’ll be so proud of you. It must
be such a comfort for an engaged man when
he knows that his people and his friends <em>can see
what he means</em> when he shows off his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> to
them for the first time, instead of their wondering
what on earth he finds to admire!”</p>

<p>“Do you think Mrs. Waters will ‘see what
he means’ by his getting himself engaged to
his clerk?” I said, with a private giggle at my
own bitterness. “I wish <em>I</em> did!”</p>

<p>“Now, Tots, don’t fish for any more compliments.
You know how people must admire
you. Why, as Mr. Vandel—I mean, it’s so
obvious! Don’t look so depressed, my dear.
Of course I suppose going to meet ‘his’ people
is always a fearful ordeal, but it ought to be less
so for you than for most engaged girls!”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>Perhaps—though Cicely doesn’t know why—<em>it
ought</em>!</p>

<p>Anyhow, these encouraging words of my
chum’s were still echoing in my ears as a late
afternoon train bore me off from Victoria towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Sevenoaks and that terrifying visit to my
(official) mother-in-law elect. For the first time
since the days when it was a matter of course
for me to do so, I travelled first class. It
wouldn’t do for me to alight at Sevenoaks station
under the eyes of some pompous Waters domestic,
all crumpled and dusty and warm from a
compartment crowded with market-baskets and
moist babies. I am taking this man’s money to
pose as his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, and it’s only fair to him that
I should do him no discredit in any way.</p>

<p>So I travelled down in expensive seclusion,
wearing for the first time one of my new costumes,
a real success in thick tobacco-brown silk, with
a duck of a little brown hat to match. Cicely
chose that out of a big boxful “on approval”
from Madame Chérisette’s.</p>

<p>Even without Cicely’s gratifying gush on the
subject, I can’t help knowing that the smoky-cream
underlining and the trimming—a cream-coloured
feathery mount and a knot of dull-pink
buds—are delightfully becoming to a clear
brunette complexion and glossy black hair.</p>

<p>Thanks to my being an easy-to-fit small “stock
size,” I’ve got a really charming little trousseau
together at very short notice. As it’s probably
the only trousseau of any sort that I shall ever
possess now (I wonder what Sydney Vandeleur
thought of my note?), I selected it with gusto,
and I mean to enjoy the wearing of every stitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of it, from the fur-lined motor-wrap to those
American-pattern nighties that the girl in the shop
said were “so sweetly bridal-looking, Moddam.”</p>

<p>It’s been such ages since I was able to choose and
arrange a kit with garments for separate occasions
and with a definite colour-scheme; it’s so long
I’ve been, not “dressed,” but “covered”—yes!
covered in patches with something in navy-blue
that I’ve managed to afford at one time; something
in brown that I’ve “had to have” at another
time; something black that I’ve just “had by me.”</p>

<p>But now I shall be able to look “together”
once more in my favourite harmonies of soft
browns, creams and pinks. A dream of mine
on my way to the office has come true at last;
it’s a dream of a thick, clover-pink linen suit,
with touches of heavy creamy lace in just the
right places. In just the right places, too, it
fits or falls away from me; and I don’t think
even the feminine edition of Still Waters will
be able to help being <em>rather</em> impressed by it!</p>

<p>As for Sydney Vandeleur, I know <em>he</em> would
have said——</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>I’ve been wondering whether after all I
need have sent that curt note to Sydney? Of
course, I <em>was</em> furious with him, first for coming
too late, and secondly for proposing at all after
I was powerless to accept him—he didn’t know
that; but what a position he put me into!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p><em>Could</em> I have put an end to it? (My thoughts
raced on with the train.)</p>

<p><em>Could</em> I have written that very evening to
Mr. Waters, cancelling that preposterous arrangement
with him, returning that lump sum of
salary, and saying——</p>

<p>Impossible! A hundred pounds of that salary
had had to go, irrevocably, as soon as I got it.
And already I’d broken into that remaining four
hundred in the bank! I couldn’t make up even
that.</p>

<p>How would it have been if when Sydney
proposed to me, I had replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>I can’t see you. I can’t even tell you
anything more, yet. But wait a year, and
then ask me again</i>”?</p>

</div>

<p>Since he’s “waited” <em>so</em> long——!</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>That wouldn’t have done either. It wouldn’t
be keeping my bargain. It would be “giving
away” my compact with that other, that detestable
man, who trusts after all to my word—and
after all, Sydney <em>has</em> got himself to thank
for the fact that I haven’t been choosing a
trousseau to please <em>him</em>....</p>

<p class="tb">Well! There’s nothing in <em>this</em> outfit, I
hope, that won’t pass the censorship of the most
critical glances in any big house—those of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
servants. Men-servants, I suspect, are almost
harder to “impress” than maid-servants.</p>

<p>But it was no lordly groom or supercilious
chauffeur who met me at Sevenoaks Station as
I stepped out of the train.</p>

<p>The tall, broad-shouldered figure that strode
towards me looked, in a big, grey, loose motor-coat,
so utterly different from the mind-picture
of the slimly-built, dark, Vandyke-bearded young
man that had travelled most of the way down
with me, so different, too, from the other apparition
I know only too well in immaculate “City”
get-up, that at first I didn’t recognize him.</p>

<p>Then a cap was lifted. I saw the fair hair,
brushed sleek as satin, and the keen, blonde
face of my employer.</p>

<p>Several people on the platform were glancing
at him as if he were almost as well known down
here in the country as in Leadenhall Street.</p>

<p>Then eagerly inquisitive glances were turned
to me. I caught a whisper of “Mr. William
Waters’ young lady!” I wondered if the
speaker—a prosperous-looking sort of butcher—expected
to overhear some tender greeting?
How “sold” he’d have been!</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are, Miss Trant!”—briskly
as ever. “Good afternoon. What luggage have
you? Porter, bring these things across to the
car. I’m motoring you up to the house myself,”
added Mr. Waters to me, as we left the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
station, “because there’s a little supplementary
detail I wanted to ‘put you on to,’ so to speak,
before you meet my people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?” I said inquiringly, and I mentally
reached for my pencil and pad.</p>

<p>But as I sat beside him on the comfortably
padded seat with a lovely rug drawn up over my
knees, and with a thick glass screen keeping my
<i lang="fr">chic</i> little new hat from getting blown about, I
felt the pad-and-pencil side of my life slipping
away from me as swiftly and steadily as the green
hawthorn hedges that lined the road seemed
slipping past this gliding car.</p>

<p>I had had a brute of a time just lately—now
came the reaction. I suppose it was partly
the entirely feminine sensation, thrilling every
scrap of my body, that it was once more decently
dressed! Partly, too, it was the influence of
skimming over a country road again, breathing
in untainted breezes under a blue sky with
rolling white cauliflower clouds; having a whole
smiling landscape to myself again!—for the
moment I lost count of <em>how</em> this had happened.
The thoughts of the last hour were left behind
with those of the last two years—with the mean
streets and the City smells and noises, and those
Battersea rooms, and that utter lack of space
and privacy, and that crushing sense of being
just one unit out of millions that didn’t
matter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Before I’d experienced these things, I’d lived
for nineteen years, another sort of life; and this
seemed almost like coming home to it. I felt
as if I were the fish that, having been left stranded
on the proverbial gravel path, has somehow
succeeded in flopping back to his native element.</p>

<p>I gave myself up to the luxury of the feeling—to
the exhilarating rush through the clear air.</p>

<p>And I’d practically forgotten who was driving
me, when his business-like voice sounded once
more in my ear.</p>

<p>“Miss Trant! Your Christian name, as I
saw by your note to my mother, is Monica?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I supposed he was now going to ask me if I
had any objection to his addressing me thus
as long as I was his mother’s guest. Why, of
course, he’d <em>have</em> to! Just as I should have to
bring myself to use his own name of “William.”
(“<em>Ahem!</em> <em>Wil</em>-liam!” as Miss Robinson pronounced
it pompously.) How queer to have
to be asked to accord one’s Christian name under
such terms! Really, he might have taken it
as a matter of course that he must, for the next
fortnight or so, call me “Monica.” Therefore
I was rather taken aback by his next remark.</p>

<p>“I shall have to ask you if you would mind
very much, while you are staying at The Lawn,
being called ‘<i>Nancy</i>’?”</p>

<p>“Nancy!” I echoed, opening my eyes. “Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
yes—no—I mean—anything you like; but why
<em>Nancy</em>?”</p>

<p>Mr. Waters turned to me for a moment as the
car sped smoothly down a level, empty stretch
of the white highway.</p>

<p>“I’d better explain to you ‘why Nancy,’”
he said dryly. In those keen grey eyes of his,
where some time before I had suspected a gleam
of humour, I now saw a quite unmistakable
twinkle of fun!</p>

<p>There was even a twitch at the corner of those
tightly-fitted lips. But he went on still more
dryly. “When I informed my mother that
I was engaged to be married to a lady in the office,
she had a good many questions to put.”</p>

<p>(Well, I should think so! The Longer Catechism,
in fact!) “Really?” I said meekly.</p>

<p>“And almost the first thing she asked me
was what her Christian name was.”</p>

<p>(M’m, “almost”—I wonder what the <em>very
first</em> thing was? What is it generally?)</p>

<p>“Of course, I ought to have foreseen that——”</p>

<p>(And <em>hadn’t</em> he? Good gracious! The
mapped-out scheme with <em>another</em> flaw in it!)</p>

<p>—“but curiously enough, I’d overlooked it,
and wasn’t prepared for it. Now, I couldn’t
very well tell my mother the truth, namely,
that I did not know. I have never been able
to make out whether your usual initials were
‘M’ or ‘N.T.’ I had taken it for ‘N.’ So, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the spur of the moment, I gave her the first girl’s
name that began with N that I could think of.”</p>

<p>N or M! Yes! <em>Exactly</em> like the catechism!</p>

<p>For the first time in my life in Still Waters’
presence I laughed aloud. Surely the country
air and the rush through it in the car must have
gone to my head. Amazed at myself, but even
then laughing a little still, I pulled myself together
to inquire, “And what did you say to
Mrs. Waters when she received my note signed
by my real name?”</p>

<p>“Oh!—I said—something or other about
‘Nancy’ being the usual abbreviation for
‘Monica’ in some places!”</p>

<p>“How <em>quick</em> of you!” I retorted—while my
Near Oriental self sat back and gasped at my new
boldness. He <em>must</em> have wondered at it too;
thought it bravado, the recklessness of despair,
I suppose.</p>

<p>“<em>Something</em> had to be said! And I am afraid,
Miss Trant, that, for the matter in hand, ‘<i>Nancy</i>’
it will have to be. A sort of <i lang="fr">nom-de-guerre</i>, you
know—if you can call it ‘<i lang="fr">guerre</i>.’”</p>

<p>He was actually laughing himself now. This
made his face look at least ten years younger,
changing him so that I felt him to be even more
of a stranger to me than the machine-like autocrat
who rapped out his “<i>Now, Miss Trant!</i>”
and his “<i>Take this down</i>” at the Near Oriental.
But in a moment he was serious again. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
seemed, for the first time, to feel something of
what <em>I’ve</em> been feeling ever since we’ve been—so
to speak, “engaged.”</p>

<p>“It’s asking a good deal, but I have to trust
to you to meet all these awkwardnesses as well
as you can,” he said gravely. “And I’ll do all
in my power to avoid them, I assure you. A
good deal of the strangeness can be put down
to the—er—natural shyness of people who are—so—er—recently
engaged.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” I murmured, struggling not
to laugh any more.</p>

<p>But I wondered what other wild fictions
about “<i>Nancy</i>” he’d had to improvise for his
mother. Supposing she’d wanted to know what
I was like to <em>look</em> at? Well, <em>he</em> wouldn’t know!
Dark or fair—short or tall? As likely as not
he’d tell her—as <em>something</em> had to be said—that
I was six foot high and a radiant blonde. And
what would she think of his not possessing a
single photograph of me to show her? Really,
he was almost benighted enough, since he’d
given me another girl’s name, to pass off as mine
another girl’s portrait!</p>

<p>Even as I was laughing to myself again, the
car turned in at a stone-pillared entrance, and
its plumply-tyred wheels purred on a perfectly-gravelled
drive between tall laurel-hedges.</p>

<p>Oh! we were nearly there, then. I didn’t want
to laugh any more. Now for it....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">MEETING “HIS” PEOPLE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>We skirted what seemed like an ocean of
green velvet turf. We swept round
another corner.</p>

<p>“There’s the house,” announced Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em>——?”</p>

<p>It was long and low and white and homely—yes!
<em>homely</em>-looking—overgrown with purple wistaria,
and swept at one end by a fountain of gold
from an immense laburnum-tree. A deep, shady
verandah was flung like a protecting arm about
the waist of the house.</p>

<p>The late sunlight flashed on a scurry of something
all goldeny-white, as there rushed out of
the shade of this verandah what looked like a
mix-up of several dogs and flying skirts....</p>

<p>“<em>Girls?</em>” I thought, as two slender,
white-clad figures came towards me. “Who are
<em>these</em>?”</p>

<p>“My sisters, Theodora and Blanche,” said
the Governor quickly to me. “<em>Down</em>, Cariad!
Down, sir,” to the little dog—there was only
one of him, it appeared, when he stopped frisking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
for a moment about the man who was helping
me to alight.</p>

<p>The taller of the two girls came forward first,
murmured timidly, “So glad you’ve come!”
held out both hands with an awkward, diffident
little smile that was quite charming, and bent
very shyly to kiss me. She was about eighteen,
with fair hair, and features very cleanly-cut and
something like her brother’s.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> am Blanche,” she murmured. “This is
Theo.”</p>

<p>“Theo,” seemed to be about fifteen. My
first impression of her showed me a pair of long
coltish legs and a round cowslip-bell of a head,
covered with short yellow curls. She said nothing,
but she <em>looked</em>, looked at me out of a pair
of the largest and brightest brown eyes that I
had ever met; they seemed almost the size of
the goggles in a diver’s helmet, and I felt them
following me devouringly as I was led into the
hall.</p>

<p>“Here is Nancy, Mother,” called Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>Another figure came forward to meet me.
This—his mother? A startling contrast indeed
to what I’d pictured her. She was dressed in
the soft, lacy, unshaped black that best suits an
elderly lady; and her soft, puffed-out hair was
grey all over. But that was as far as the “elderliness”
of the Governor’s mother went. Her
figure was as tall and seemed nearly as slender as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Blanche’s; she had the long-armed, free movements
that I’ve heard my father praise in Miss
Ellen Terry; her face was pink and irregular-featured
and mobile, her expression shy and
smiling. She seemed like some girl who had
fallen into a trance in the “Eighties,” from which
she had just woken up to find that her hair was
no longer brown, and that the world, which
puzzled her a little, had gone on without her.
Her voice was soft and hesitating, and full of
unexpected half-tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you come? Nancy! You are
so welcome, my dear! I called you ‘Miss Trant’
in my note, because I thought it was the right
thing when I hadn’t ever seen you. But I
needn’t go on being so stiff, need I? Billy said
he thought I needn’t.”</p>

<p>The Governor had disappeared towards the
car again.</p>

<p>“Your boxes have gone upstairs, dear, and you
might like to rest before it’s time to get ready for
dinner. <em>Blanche</em> will take you to your room,”
added Mrs. Waters, holding back Theo, whose
yellow head and whose long legs seemed just
about to precipitate themselves after me—for
that child to enjoy another good look, no doubt.
“<em>No</em>, Cariad, you can’t go either! <em>Come</em>,
Missis’s little dog”—the long white body was
frolicking about just ahead of me. “He <em>knows</em>
he never enters the house!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>And I knew the pet dogs who are supposed
to cherish these rules. Cariad flung himself
gleefully in front of the diffident, fair-haired
Blanche as she escorted me upstairs.</p>

<p>We were on the landing when the sound of a
voice that I hadn’t heard before, clear as a bell
and distinct as a choir-boy’s solo, rang up to us
from below.</p>

<p>“No <em>won</em>-der, Mother! Mother, I say, no
<em>won</em>-der! <em>Is</em>-n’t she pretty? Billy never <em>told</em>
us! He never——.”</p>

<p>Here an abrupt full-stop.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope you won’t mind Theo; she
<em>is</em> rather awful sometimes,” murmured Blanche
Waters, as apologetically scarlet as if she had done
something to offend me. “She will say things—and
so <em>loud</em>! It’s <em>only</em> because she’s so pleased—and
she’s only thirteen really—it’s awful being
so tall. People always expect you to be so much
more sensible, somehow! This is your room.”
She opened a white door. “Outside, Cariad!
(He <em>knows</em> he never comes upstairs.) Do let me
unpack for you, Nancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Thank you so much, but——”</p>

<p>I felt I must, <em>must</em> be left to myself for the
present. At the risk of seeming ungracious, I
added hastily, “I can manage, really!”</p>

<p>Even though I’m <em>not</em> fated to be a sister-in-law,
I should like this nice girl to like me. So I
smiled up at her, and she put out a long, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
bony young finger, and just touched my coat-collar.
I realized that I needn’t have “fussed”
so over my “trousseau.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I daresay you’re tired, too.”</p>

<p>“I am, rather.” (Strictly speaking, I am
ready to drop, though not entirely with fatigue.)</p>

<p>“Then I’ll send up some hot water presently,
Nancy. (<em>Come</em>, Cariad!)”</p>

<p>And she left me to what I felt I must have or
perish—the solitude of my own room, leisure to
gasp over the series of additional shocks I had
just received.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>First and foremost, though it seems a funny
detail to push itself in front of all the other things,
there’s “<i>Billy!</i>”</p>

<p>To think that Still Waters should be “Billy”
to anyone—even if it’s only to his mother!</p>

<p>After Miss Holt’s “Do you ever call him <i>Billy</i>,
by any chance?” and my solemn “Never!” to
realize that the man who Miss Robinson vowed
“could never have been anything so human as
a little boy” does actually possess that characteristically
little-boyish pet-name! And I
suppose I shall be expected to call him that while
I’m here? My goodness! “William” I was
prepared for. “William,” with its touch of
stiffness—and—stateliness, I might manage.
But——Still, if I must, I must. In for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
penny, in for a pound. (Only in this case it’s
meant being in for five hundred pounds!)</p>

<p>And then that he should have that unexpected,
that utterly uncharacteristic, that un-Waters-like
sort of mother! Welcoming me like that!
All I can say is that he—the Governor—<em>must</em>
take after his father exactly!</p>

<p>And the house! Not in the least like a sarcophagus—or
even the corner of the British
Museum with Near Oriental fittings, as <em>I’d</em>
pictured it!</p>

<p>Looking round this bedroom they’ve put me
into, I see it’s exactly the sort that I’ve always
loved, particularly since my lot has been cast
in that poky little egg-box of a Battersea flat,
with one skimpy strip of bedroom window giving
on a view of grimy-grey back-yard, a kennel made
out of a packing-case, and lines of washing
hanging out to dry.</p>

<p>Here, at The Lawn, my quarters do seem so
palatially big and airy! There’s <em>miles</em> of wardrobe
space for my new things, I see. And <em>what</em>
a lovely long mirror! That delicious scent of
lavender and pot-pourri comes from the big
china bowl on the window-ledge. There’s a
wide bay of casement-windows looking out on
to that wonderful lawn, sprays of feathery mauve
wistaria tap against the panes outside. Inside,
rose-peonies and giant tulips riot over the cream-and-red-and-pink-patterned
chintzes of hangings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and upholstery. The wallpaper is sprinkled
with bouquets of rosebuds caught up with
ribbons; and the bed-spread is of glowing rose-colour.
No trace anywhere of those “Art-muds”
and sad sage-greens that even well-off
people get into their rooms so often now. Why
can’t they realize that greens, to be successful,
must be kept out of doors? Green as an indoor
background, <em>no!</em> I’d have chosen just these
gay, dainty patterns and colours for my bedroom,
if——</p>

<p>But <em>what’s</em> the use of thinking over the house I
might have had? I’m not going to. I ought
to be breathlessly thankful that this one where I
have to spend a fortnight is turning out to be so
much more congenial than I’d hoped, and that
“his” people are quite unlike “him!”</p>

<p>How suddenly “right” my dear old silver-and-crystal
toilette things look against the setting
of the Sheraton dressing-table with the plate-glass
top! To think that one dismal wet day I
nearly packed them all up and sent them off by
Mrs. Skinner to be “put away,” and the price
thereof turned into new boots! “Boots a poor
typist must have,” I argued. “Silver-topped
bottles and luxuries of that sort she doesn’t
need any more.” How frightfully glad I am, now,
that I hadn’t the heart to do it after all, that I
sent my shoes to be re-soled instead—and that
all my own monogrammed brushes are mirrored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
in the oval glass beside that lustre jar of rich,
mahogany-coloured wall-flowers that, next to
my own dark head and its moving reflections,
seem to give the deepest touch of colour in the
room. I suppose the girls put those there—Yes!
That’s another shock. The <em>sisters</em>! That
<em>he</em> should have sisters like——</p>

<p>A tap at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!”</p>

<p>Enter, explosively, the excited little white
dog, followed by a large and shiny copper can,
and the eyes—they seem to dominate everything
else about that child!—of Theodora.</p>

<p>“Brought you some hot water”—in a meek
and muffled voice. “Dinner is—(Put those
<em>down</em>, Cariad! He <em>knows</em> people’s slippers aren’t
for him to eat!) Dinner is at eight. <em>I’m</em> not
supposed to come down.”</p>

<p>Here the huge brown eyes turned ruefully
for a moment from me to the gleaming sheath
of the new frock that I’d just thrown over the
brass rail of the bed. I guessed the thought
behind them. They longed for another satisfying
stare at it—<em>on</em> me.</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t I have this child fond of me?</p>

<p>“Shall I say good-night now, then, Theo?”
I suggested. “Or—if you tell me which your
room is, shall I come in after I’m dressed?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Theo, bell-mouthed.
“<em>Gem!</em>” Then, carefully muffling the voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
again, “That’s the school-room door opposite—between
the corridor window and the picture
of ‘Delia in Arcady.’ Thanks <em>awf’ly</em>, Nancy.
(<em>Come</em> along, Cariad!)”</p>

<p>Not every engaged girl has such a walk-over
with “his” people! But I think Theo would
approve of me as a sister-in-law, if she were
going to have the chance! I shouldn’t mind
<em>her</em>!... On second thoughts, I don’t know
whether I am so pleased after all that these
people are so kind and welcoming and different
from what I had expected.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be almost easier for me in some
ways if his mother and his sisters <em>were</em> the “collection
of frosty-faces” (as Miss Robinson expresses
it) whom I’d anticipated meeting? I
was prepared; I could have coped with <em>them</em>.
Why has he got sisters like these—just the kind
of girls I could imagine sisters of <em>mine</em>?</p>

<p>Why <em>must</em> his mother be so sweet to me,
without a gleam of the “designing-little-minx-of-a-typist”
look in her eyes, without—I verily
believe—a thought of it in her heart? Ready
to take to her arms the stranger within her gates
whom she looks upon as her son’s lady-love—oh,
it’s too embarrassing!</p>

<p>For the first time since this sham engagement
was arranged between my employer and myself,
I feel what I did not feel when I confronted
my fellow-typists, the Vandeleurs or Cicely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
with the news that I was Mr. Waters’ <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>;
what I did not feel when I first slipped these
lying diamonds on to my finger; what I didn’t
feel when I cabled that money to Jack, or even
when I wrote to Sydney.</p>

<p>I feel—there is no other word to express it—downright
<em>mean</em>!</p>

<p>How am I going to stand a whole fortnight
of it? How <em>am</em> I to keep up this incessant pose
and pretence under the gentle, unsuspecting
eyes of Mrs. Waters?</p>

<p>I believe I could have calmly invented fib after
fib for the benefit of Lady Vandeleur——</p>

<p>Now, now! Thoughts beginning with
“Vandeleur” have got to be sternly suppressed
unless I mean to give myself a fit of the blues
and make some terrible <i lang="fr">faux pas</i> presently, at
dinner, in the bosom of the Governor’s family.</p>

<p>So come, Monica Trant, my child—“Nancy,”
I mean, of course, <em>Nancy</em>! (How I hope I
shall remember to answer to that name when I
hear it, instead of forgetting who they mean
and imagining it’s the little white dog!)
You pull yourself together, Nancy, and dive
into the pretty new evening-frock—it will be
gorgeous to have proper lights and a real glass
to dress by once again!—then go and show it
off to that avid-eyed child in the school-room.
And then downstairs with you, to earn some more
of your five hundred pounds!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST DINNER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Well! the first evening is over.</p>

<p>It hasn’t been nearly as bad as it
might, though it certainly has produced several
more quite unexpected developments.</p>

<p>We dined; for the first time for well over a year
I sat down at a luxuriously-appointed round
dinner-table with all its conventional daintiness
of perfect napery, silver and glass—instead of
the picnic-supper affair, with every single plate
and fork an “oddment,” cast by the hands of
Mrs. Skinner upon the rickety table at Marconi
Mansions. Instead of gossiping with Cicely
Harradine clad in the faded green Japanese
kimono that she finds “such a rest to slop into”
after all the fashionable dressing-up at Chérisette’s—for
Cicely is rather the type of girl
whom work demoralizes instead of bracing—I
was of a party of two other women and a man in
evening-dress.</p>

<p>That dinner-jacket does make the Governor
look so much younger—it’s positively laughable!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
For another thing, it seems to take him right
out of his isolated Near Oriental niche, and to
put him in the same rank of human beings as
men who used to dine at our house when my
father was alive. Positively, I have begun to
look upon my once-dreaded employer as quite
an ordinary—though certainly <em>not</em> a likable—sort
of young man! Never again need <em>he</em>
expect to keep up, with me, the attitude of a
metallic species of Business-deity who disappears
after business-hours to some vague, chilly
and unknown Olympus, of which no glimpse
would ever be vouchsafed to any of us, his
grovelling subordinates. Oh, no!</p>

<p>Not now that I’ve seen his people, the pretty
things out of which his mother has made such
a nest of a home for him; not after making the
acquaintance of Blanche and of that gift of
God, Theodora, and of Cariad. That little outdoor
dog spent the whole of dinner-time cosily
curled up under the table on his “Missis’s”
black satin skirt, and not all the flappings of the
Governor’s table-napkin or his curtest “Here!
Out of that, Cariad! Outside, sir!” had the
slightest effect in dislodging him. I would
have given at least five of my as yet unearned
five hundred pounds for Miss Robinson to have
been granted the sight of Still Waters cheerfully
defied by that small Sealyham! I can see her
“potting” the scene, with Miss Holt’s white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
feather neck-ruffle commandeered to represent
the little dog who “<em>knows</em> that skirts aren’t
there for him to sit upon!” And <em>I’m</em> not
“there to be sat upon” any more, either! I’m
beginning to wonder how the Governor managed
to “take me in” for so long! Why, he is a
regular <em>fraud</em>! And a fraud found out is never
terrifying—even if it’s exasperating.</p>

<p>If anyone is going to be alarmed now, it’s not
his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, but he himself; for he was—yes,
positively!—nervous and embarrassed at
dinner. If that had been the first time I’d met
him I should have thought that the big and
blonde and silent young man opposite was <em>deadly
shy of me</em>! Of <em>me</em>; after all that he had handed
out to me in the way of orders and commands
and arrangements during the past fortnight.
It is a good thing if, as he says, a good deal of
the “strangeness” will be put down to the
“natural awkwardness of people so recently
engaged”—but it’s a still better thing that I
contrived to be rather less “awkward” and
speechless than <em>he</em> was! To myself I seemed
to be sitting a little apart, watching another
Mon—Nancy, I mean—smiling and chatting
gaily with his mother and the younger girls.</p>

<p>What dears they are! and how one sees their
feminine touch in everything about the room,
from the arrangement of the many and becoming
lights, to the graceful massing of sulphur-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
pansies and gypsophila in the centre of the round
table!</p>

<p>At dinner it was chiefly, I think, of flowers
that we talked—such a nice, safe subject. It
seems that the Governor is actually interested
in gardening. <em>How</em> amazed the staff would be
if it were hinted that Still Waters took the
vaguest gleam of interest in anything outside
making money for the firm!</p>

<p>After dinner, when he remained behind in
the dining-room to smoke, his mother slipped one
white hand into Blanche’s arm, the other into
mine; and the gesture, I know, was meant to
imply that she had “another daughter now.”</p>

<p>We stepped together across the black-and-white-tiled
hall into the drawing-room, with its
ordered chaos of pretty, old-fashioned furniture
and dainty new things, and the unmistakable
atmosphere of a homey room that is lived in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters drew me down beside her on the
wide, shallow sofa, and I saw her eyes dwelling
on every line of my face, as if she were trying to
learn fresh knowledge of her son from the girl
who presumably was permitted to see him as his
own mother never sees a man.</p>

<p>That brought a lump into my throat. I bent
my head over my work—a bit of Richelieu
embroidery with which I had taken care to provide
myself. I had remembered some axioms of Miss
Robinson at the office:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Never you be without a hit of fancy-work,
girls, when you wish to impress. Men seem to
think a girl must be so sweet and womanly who
can sit for hours wagging a crochet-hook and a bit
of thread at them. As for the future mother-in-law,
she always imagines a girl is more likely
to turn out domesticated if she cannot keep her hands
still for ten minutes. Besides, a bit of drawn-thread
work, or whatever it is, gives you something
to look at when you don’t exactly know what
to say next.</i>”</p>

<p>The last reason was mine. I certainly did
not know what to say when the Governor’s
mother remarked softly:</p>

<p>“You know, Nancy, you are just what I hoped
you would be.”</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>I felt an unutterable little <em>cad</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. William Waters! And who forced
me into the position of feeling like this?</p>

<p>“So pretty and gentle and quiet, and yet
you ‘see’ things with those brown eyes of yours,”
pronounced Mrs. Waters. “At first I feared
it was impossible that any girl who had only
met my boy just in business-hours, and wearing
that office-mask he has to put on, could grow to
care for him as we do; but I see you could understand.
You guessed that all that brusqueness
and peremptory manner were just the armour
for his sensitiveness; you would see that he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
to put on that manner to hide the awful truth
that at the bottom of his heart he is naturally
as shy and nervous as Blanche and I are. <em>I</em>
believe,” she laughed softly, “that that’s why he
<em>never</em> allows us to call at the office while we’re
in town! The staff <em>might</em> suspect, seeing <em>us</em>,
that he <em>has</em> another sort of manner than the
terrible one he speaks through the telephone
with! I dare say that even you were taken in
by it at first, weren’t you? Until he began to
reveal his real self to you, I expect you looked
upon him merely as a business-machine, didn’t
you, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I did,” I murmured, feeling more
uncomfortable at every word uttered by this
dear, innocent lady, who had created such an
idealized version of her son’s character.</p>

<p>“And when did you begin to find out the
real Billy?”</p>

<p><em>Here</em> was a nice question! Thank goodness
I was spared the answering of it!</p>

<p>At that moment the drawing-room door
opened to admit the tallest of the admirable
parlour-maids, with the tray bearing a silver
coffee-machine and the dainty Dresden service.</p>

<p>Blanche rose from the cushion where she had
been sitting at my feet, and went to the table
to officiate. In her simple white dinner-gown
she looked like a tall lily bending down.</p>

<p>“Mother, plenty of hot milk and a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
sugar? Nancy, how do you like your
coffee?”</p>

<p>“I don’t take it, thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then here’s Billy’s—black, with plenty
of sugar. Will he be coming in for it?”</p>

<p>Her mother gave a little smile.</p>

<p>“I think perhaps Nancy won’t mind taking
in Billy’s coffee to him. Will you, dear? He’s
in his ‘den’; the door just opposite, across the
hall.”</p>

<p>Even without her gently mischievous glance
I should have realized what she meant. The
unsuspecting, sympathetic creature thought she
was being kind and tactful, making an opportunity
for me to have a little time alone with
my <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>.</p>

<p>She imagined that we were longing for a
lovers’ <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, with all the fond, foolish talk
that one could guess at—beaming smiles at each
other, like Smithie’s—Ordinary love-making!
Yes, of course, people will have to be allowed to
think that there’s that between us, too. I
hadn’t wasted many thoughts on this aspect of
the case. But this “rubbed it in.”</p>

<p>I felt a wave of scorching scarlet rush up my
face to the roots of my hair. However, that
didn’t matter: no doubt Mrs. Waters put it
down to the “natural shyness” of a girl in love.
She never guessed the <em>furious</em> mixture of feelings
that sent that blush into my cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>I kept my head up and my voice quite steady
as I replied: “Oh, certainly!”</p>

<p>And I rose, taking up the green-garlanded
cup with the small gilt apostle-spoon in the
saucer, and left the drawing-room to face my
first official <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with the Governor.</p>

<p>Ever since he’s been the unconscious cause
of my having had to give up the chance of a
serene and happy future with the man who really
cares for me, I’ve looked upon my employer
with a mixture of resentment and dread. As I
say, the dread’s melted rapidly. But the resentment’s
growing!</p>

<p>“<em>I’ll</em> make him pay, somehow,” thought I
revengefully, “for all this!” By “all this”
I meant not only for the loss of Sydney, and the
castle at Ballycool, and comfort and position,
but for making me look and feel so acutely foolish
before Mrs. Waters.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can’t make him rather uncomfortable
over it himself,” I determined.</p>

<p>I crossed the hall, forcing myself to feel as
if I were back in the office, where we typists
took it in turn to carry Mr. Dundonald’s cup
of afternoon tea into the inner sanctum, where
he glowered over his figures.</p>

<p>(How cross he was if one of us shook the cup
so that some of the tea slopped over and soaked
the lump of sugar and the biscuit laid in the
saucer.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>Gingerly I carried the dainty cup of black
coffee across to the door of the “den.”</p>

<p>There, deliberately, I tapped twice.</p>

<p>The sound of my knock on the door reminded
me of another occasion—on which I’d presented
myself alone before the Governor, that afternoon
at the Near Oriental; that first interview
in his office.</p>

<p>This <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>—the first in his own home—was
going to be very different!</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST TÊTE-À-TÊTE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>A rather surprised voice called “Come
in!”</p>

<p>In I went—to find the Governor smoking a
cigarette and sitting on the wide red-leather-padded
club-fender of a room that was in
complete contrast to the feminine domain I
had left. Almost empty, but for its tall bookshelves,
a grandfather’s clock, a couple of solid,
“man-ny-looking” arm-chairs and a grand
piano.</p>

<p>I dropped my voice into its meekest Near
Oriental tone as I announced:</p>

<p>“Your coffee, Mr. Waters!”</p>

<p>It was exactly the tone in which I’d so often
said, “Your tea, Mr. Dundonald!” and yet I
knew that the man before me would guess that
this deference was, under the circumstances,
only a subtle form of defiance.</p>

<p>I handed him the cup. Then I stood there,
outwardly as mild as milk, before him. One
swift glance into the mirror over the mantelpiece
beyond his broad shoulder—his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
are the best thing about him—had shown me
an attractive picture enough—a big, blonde man
faced by a <i lang="fr">petite</i>, graceful girl, with her night-black
hair swathed in a silky garland round her
head, and her white shoulders and neck emerging
from an admirably-cut dinner-gown of creamy
charmeuse and chiffon patterned by rose-pink
beadwork, whose colour echoed the soft flush
in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Just before dinner, Theo, in the school-room,
with all her eyes and half the voice-power at
her command, had told me the dress was <em>divine</em>,
and that I looked a little <em>angel</em> in it!</p>

<p>“Angel?” H’m. That wasn’t how I <em>felt</em>,
exactly. Still I know I looked my best; as
pretty as ever I’d looked in the dear old days
before I had anything else to do.</p>

<p>Looking her best always keys a girl up to doing
her best.</p>

<p>(Or her worst, as the case may be.)</p>

<p>Besides, another glance at the Governor
had shown me that I’d been right in my suspicion
at dinner. He <em>was</em> embarrassed. He was—probably
for the first time in his life—<em>shy</em>!</p>

<p>This put the finishing touch to my feeling
myself to be—also for the first time—mistress
of this situation.</p>

<p>Therefore, I stood there, still waiting, looking
as if it were I who were paralysed with shyness,
deliberately waiting for <em>him</em> to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” he had murmured as he took
the cup from me. There was another pause,
which was—as I fully intended—the first of many.
Then he added, in a rather uncertain sort of
voice, “I suppose it was my mother’s—my
mother who sent you in here?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes,” I said hastily, as if
breathlessly flurried and meek beyond all words.
“She seemed to think—I didn’t know what
else to do—am I in your way?” (Here I
glanced up at him with scared, appealing eyes
as much as to say, “Is it my fault if I am?”)</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said the Governor, rather as
if the words were forced from him, “that I
shall have to ask you to put with up this—er—incongruity
for the next half-hour or so. Won’t
you sit down, Miss Trant?” And he wheeled
forward one of those capacious arm-chairs,
placing it at a mercifully wide distance from the
fender-stool—where Mrs. Waters perhaps imagined
we were at that moment sitting—Oh
shade of everything that’s wildly impossible!—sitting
together like ordinary young engaged
people, hand in hand—or however they <em>do</em>
sit. My goodness!</p>

<p>I sat down, dropping my eyes demurely, and
folding my hands in my lap.</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“I—er——” said the Governor, then stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and tried to look as if he hadn’t begun a
sentence.</p>

<p>“Yes? Is there anything that I can—that
you think I ought to be able to do for you while
I am here, Mr. Waters?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it might be wiser if you stopped
calling me by that name”—dryly. He seemed
to have pulled himself together with a jerk,
for he was looking and speaking more like himself
at this. However, it had no effect on <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>“Oh, of <em>course</em>,” I said obediently, “I shall
<em>always</em> remember to call you B——by your
Christian name (<em>that</em> is an abbreviation, too,
isn’t it?) when we are with the others.”</p>

<p>“And then, if you use my other name when
we are alone, you may forget, and let it slip out
when the others are here,” he objected, looking
down on me from his perch on the fender-stool,
“and—and it’s more than likely that my sisters
might notice. Theodora notices everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes”—gently—“so I gather.”</p>

<p>“And always says out what she thinks,” her
brother informed me. “That’s why—if you
don’t mind—I am going to continue calling
you ‘Nancy’ even when we are alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” I said softly. “And I
suppose I must practise trying not to feel afraid
of you.”</p>

<p>He looked sharply at me, but I know there
was no expression in my face, and my eyes seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
fixed upon the hands in my lap, upon the ring
I was turning, idly, round my engagement-finger.</p>

<p>“Afraid of me?” he took up. “You?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Waters—I <em>beg</em> your pardon, I didn’t
mean to use that name again. I was going to
say, you know that we are all terrified to death
of you—at the office.”</p>

<p>I know he guessed that I meant “<i>but this is
not the office, and I’ve lost all the wholesome awe
that I still had of you only yesterday, and I’m no
more terrified of you than Cariad is, now!</i>”
Without looking directly at him, I saw his keen,
blonde face flush a little under its tan—this
City-fied young man is oddly sunburned—and
his firmly-fitted lips moved as if he were going
to say something but thought better of it.
After a pause he opened them again and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you smoke—er—Nancy?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks very much,” I said primly.</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>The Governor cleared his throat.</p>

<p>I knew he literally couldn’t think what to
say next, and I exulted inwardly. I felt as if
I really were getting a little of my own back
now—not only for the awkwardness and unpleasantness
due to the “engagement,” but
for everything I’ve loathed while I’ve been at
the Near Oriental—the dreary journey there
morning after morning, the monotony, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
irksomeness, the daily looming terror of “the
sack,” the hated hoverings round me of Mr.
Dundonald and his “<em>talk</em>-ing!”</p>

<p><em>Oh</em>, how my employer was longing for me to
“talk” at <em>that</em> moment! to say something—anything!</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t. I think I could have let
that lagging silence last for quite another five
minutes as far as I was concerned, only I was
afraid I might break into wild laughter unless
I spoke. So I gave it up, and suggested gravely
and helpfully:</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> got some fancy-work with me, but
I left it in the drawing-room. Shall I go back
and fetch it? Or—wouldn’t that quite <em>do</em>?”</p>

<p>“Afraid not,” said the Governor grimly.</p>

<p>“It seems so stupid to sit here doing nothing;
for you, too,” I added sympathetically. “If
you have brought any letters down here from
the office, you might, perhaps, care to dictate
them to me——”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” said Mr. Waters firmly. “I
seldom do any business out of business-hours.”</p>

<p>I turned my ring again ostentatiously. I
hope he knew I was pointing out to him how
<em>my</em> “business” had to go on all day long—the
woman’s work, in fact, being never done!</p>

<p>My next mild suggestion was, “Do you play
picquet?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know one card from another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>I sighed, as if with mingled regret and boredom.</p>

<p>It was a very insincere sigh! for, to begin
with, I loathe any form of card-playing myself;
<em>I</em> don’t believe the story that cards were invented
to please a mad king. I believe he was <em>driven</em>
mad by the card-games of the period! Secondly,
I wasn’t one bit bored. I was revelling in the
spectacle of this wretched young man—imagine
being able to employ such a phrase to the Grand
Panjandrum himself!—this <em>wretched</em> young man
looking so acutely uncomfortable and at such a
loss.</p>

<p>Gleefully I allowed yet another long and awkward
pause to take place.</p>

<p>Then, I put my hand—the left one—up to my
mouth as if to stifle a yawn. Then I glanced
at the ship in full sail that rocked to and fro on
the face of the grandfather’s clock, and murmured
resignedly: “Only twenty minutes past
nine?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that clock is always kept ten
minutes fast,” said my host.</p>

<p>I sighed again, more deeply.</p>

<p>Then I allowed my eyes to wander, as if
vainly seeking the way of escape!—round the
comfortable, masculine-looking room. Actually,
my glance was caught by an odd-looking arrangement
of wires across the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, what are those for?” I asked. “Telegraphy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“No; I had those put there to improve the
acoustics of this room. It was otherwise so bad
to play and sing in.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said, and wondering why Blanche
didn’t use the drawing-room to sing in, I glanced
at the somber shape of the piano at the other
end of the den.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you would allow me to practise
in here sometimes—of course, only in the mornings?”
I requested meekly. “When I go back
to London, I shall want to see about a situation
as music-teacher or something of that kind. I
must have some definite work to do—besides
yours, I mean!—and I ought to furbish up my
playing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you play, do you?” said Mr. Waters,
in a tone of the deepest relief. “Good!”</p>

<p>He got up, switched on some more lights,
and opened the piano.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you have a rarer accomplishment
still. Can you accompany?”</p>

<p>“I should be able to,” said I, with a little
bitter smile to myself.</p>

<p>For I’ve certainly spent hours enough at the
piano with Sydney Vandeleur, practising or
transposing his lyrics. He has a gift for pretty,
tender melody-writing; he “sets” all his favourite
verses....</p>

<p>“Will you try over a song with me, then?”</p>

<p>(What! It was <em>he</em> who sang?)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>This was not my subdued, Leadenhall Street
office “Certainly.” It was the way in which I
might have spoken to Sydney, or to Major Montresor,
or the Somervilles, or any of the men who
came to my father’s house in the old days, and for
whom I played in the evening.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. This gets in the way;
clicks on the keys,” said I, glancing at those
weighty diamonds that blazed on my finger.
And I drew off his ring, pushing it with a careless
little flick out of my way on the glassy black
top of the piano. He had put up before me
Schubert’s “<cite lang="de">Still wie die Nacht</cite>.”</p>

<p>Appropriate enough, for Still Waters! “Still
as the night, deep as the sea——”</p>

<p>I took up the first chords.</p>

<p>Then came surprise again.</p>

<p>I had expected him to possess a big, bull-dog
bass, full of sound and fury, and without a touch
of feeling in it. To my amazement, his voice
turned out to be a particularly sweet, true tenor.
Shut your eyes, and you could imagine that it
was the most sympathetic and delightful of men
who was singing, instead of <em>the Governor</em>!</p>

<p>Can there be many more surprises about this
man? However, I flatter myself that I’ve given
him several. The crushed-looking, deferential
typist in the ready-made delaine blouse, and
with the carbon-stained fingers, that shook with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
nervousness when he rattled off his far-too-quick
dictation to them, was a distinct contrast to this
dainty, well-dressed young woman, who lays her
own plans for him to see that she is laughing at
him in her sleeve.</p>

<p>And it’s his turn to use deference to me.</p>

<p>“Thank you, so much—er—Nancy.” This
last word brought out with a jerk of resolution.
“It’s a treat to be accompanied by someone who
can do it so unusually well; it’s like waltzing with
a partner whose step just suits one’s own.”</p>

<p>Good gracious! Where and when has this
man learned to dance?</p>

<p>But he <em>can</em> sing. I quite enjoyed playing
for it. I think we went through quite half
a dozen songs—“Widdicombe Fair” was one of
them—before I remembered that this wasn’t
the form I meant <em>my</em> enjoyment to take.</p>

<p>So, when he put up yet another—“Drake’s
Drum” this time—and said, “Shall we try this?”
I relapsed into my wickedly mild manner once
more, and replied hesitatingly: “Don’t you
think that would be enough—for Mrs. Waters?
I mean, that she would consider I had stayed the
right length of time? May—mayn’t I get
down, now?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Sorry if I have tired you,” said the
Governor quietly.</p>

<p>He walked across the room to open the door
for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>There, with his hand on the door-knob, my
employer paused and looked down at me almost
as if he were looking at me for the first time.</p>

<p>It was a curious sort of stare, half-amused,
half-frowning. I should think it must have
lasted while one could count five. Was there
a sort of <em>threat</em> in it? Yes! I suppose it meant
that he wasn’t going to stand any more of my
masquerading impertinences, that somehow he
meant to overawe me, to keep the upper hand
over me still. But he won’t. Of course it’s
rather flurrying to be looked at like that, so hard
and unexpectedly.... But I wasn’t <em>really</em>
flurried——only a little glad when he opened the
door, said “Good night!” and shut it after me.</p>

<p>I was turning towards the haven of the
drawing-room when, half-way across the hall,
I heard the door of the “den” open again, and
the Governor’s step behind me.</p>

<p>“I think you forgot this, didn’t you?” he
said, holding out to me the ring I had left lying
on the top of the piano.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>thank</em> you,” I said apologetically. He
went back into the den. I slipped my “engagement”
ring on to my finger again.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I <em>hadn’t</em> “forgotten” it.</p>

<p>And he needn’t imagine that he is ever going
to have <em>me</em> “quelled” again. I intend taking
it out of <em>him</em> all the time I am here!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST QUARREL</span></h2>

</div>

<p>So far I have had things all my own way.</p>

<p>During the three days that I have now
been staying at The Lawn, I have managed
to “keep up” without difficulty two utterly
distinct and different <em>manners</em>.</p>

<p>“Manner A.”—assumed for the benefit of the
Governor’s family—the rather shy but charming
and devoted young <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>.</p>

<p>“Manner B.”—well, to be frank, a perfect
little <em>cat</em>!</p>

<p>But to begin with the first manner.</p>

<p>I should be ashamed to act it as well as I do,
if it weren’t that I must keep the whip-hand
over the Governor, and that this is the only way,
for his mother and sisters are really too sweet
with me.</p>

<p>Never, during all the palmy days of the Trant
family, have I had so many pretty and generous
things said about me as I’ve heard in these three
days from my employer’s unsuspecting mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>She told me yesterday, “When Billy was ten
I’d begun to wonder whether, somewhere, some
other mother was watching a pink-lined cot that
held something which was to become very
precious, later on, to my little son. And—twenty-one,
are you, dear?—it must have been
so, then. How glad I am it was you! Ten years
is such a nice difference in age, too; I was twenty-one——”</p>

<p>And her soft grey eyes looked at me as if they
saw, through me, into the past.</p>

<p>Her young daughter Blanche, on the other
hand, gazes at me as wistfully as though, through
me, she could look into the future. I feel as if
I were supposed to be standing beside a wall
which only I am tall enough (for once!) to see
over.</p>

<p>“<i>Sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?</i>”
That, of course, isn’t what she says.</p>

<p>“Nancy, I suppose you knew almost at once
what you felt about Billy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” (Readily.)</p>

<p>“You knew he was absolutely the one and
only? How lovely!” A pause. “I suppose
the way to find out is to imagine him among
seventeen other young men, all frightfully good-looking
and nice and good sorts, and the right
kind of voice, and all wanting to marry you at
once, and all that? Then, if you still feel you
could choose <em>him</em> out of all those——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“But, Blanche, I should have <em>had</em> to,” I explained,
truthfully enough, as I thought of the
five hundred pounds. “Couldn’t help myself!”</p>

<p>“I see,” sighed Blanche. “<em>Mustn’t</em> it be
glorious for you both?”</p>

<p>And thirteen-year-old Theo, pouring upon her
“new sister” the wealth of superfluous adoration
which will some day be wasted, I suppose,
upon some quite ordinary young man, proclaims
at frequent intervals, “Isn’t it <em>ripping</em> having
her here?” and lives entirely in the present.
Theo, by the way, is the only one of them before
whom I feel I have to be careful not to over-do
Manner A.</p>

<p>Manner B. is reserved for those hours which,
for the sake of appearances, his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> is
obliged to spend alone with Mr. Waters; going
for dull walks—that is, for me they’re kept from
being too deadly dull by the certainty that I am
making them so for him!—and sitting with him
in the den, where I will <em>not</em> play accompaniments
to his songs except as a last resource after I’ve
exhausted every possibility of the stilted remark,
the awkward pause, the resigned glance, and the
languor that stops short only at the visible yawn.
Since that first <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> I have brought the
contrasting of Manners A. and B. to a fine art.
I’ve been revelling in the idea that for a whole
fortnight this is what my employer will be forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
to put up with. After all, it’s what the whole
lives of some <em>married</em> men amount to! And,
according to the terms of the Governor’s own
agreement, there’s nothing in all this of which he
can openly complain!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>He <em>has</em> complained!</p>

<p>Really, I need not have been surprised when it
occurred, though I was scarcely expecting it.</p>

<p>It began this (Saturday) morning, at breakfast.
Now, any outsider peeping into the sunny dining-room
might have considered that the group
round the breakfast-table made an ideal picture
of English family life.</p>

<p>There was the gentle, grey-gowned mother
pouring out coffee. The big, blonde son of
the house, dressed for the City, sitting opposite
to his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>—rather silent, but presumably
only out of devotion.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> herself, a small brunette in dull-pink
linen, looking, I think I may say, the picture
of girlish sweetness, and being made much of
by the two younger, taller, fair-haired sisters.</p>

<p>For no outsider could have suspected that the
small, dark girl and the big, blonde man were
secretly at daggers drawn. Nor have the family
a notion that I’m anything less than “the ideal
wife for Billy.”</p>

<p>I had come down last, to be greeted by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
clarion voice of Theo, now no longer muffled in
my presence.</p>

<p>“Nancy! <em>Here’s</em> news for you! Juno
what? Our celebrated Uncle Albert Waters
is coming down to inspect Billy’s sweetheart!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said smiling. I didn’t see then
why I shouldn’t smile. I hadn’t yet heard
anything about this other Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>“It’s to be hoped that he will admire her as
much as we all do,” proclaimed Theodora;
“because, if he doesn’t, won’t it be a ghastly
week-end, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, dear! Don’t try and alarm poor
Nancy about the new relation she has to meet.”</p>

<p>“But—fancy! Meeting Uncle Albert <em>for
the first time</em>! Golly!”</p>

<p>“Theo-dora!”</p>

<p>“I know. I did promise to chuck saying
‘Golly,’ but really it’s the only word that seems
at all <em>like</em> Uncle Albert,” declared the child.
“Uncle Albert’s a terror! Talk about me-ee!
Yes, talk about <em>me</em> saying everything that comes
into my head! Why, it’s from him that I
inherit that! Only, I’m not in it with him!”</p>

<p>“It would be a good thing if you were,
Theo,” reproachfully from Mrs. Waters. “I
am sure your uncle has a heart of gold.”</p>

<p>“Always means there’s something else the
matter with a person”—thus the irrepressible
Theo. “People with ‘hearts of gold’ are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
either fearfully rude like old Miss Crabbe, and
never say ‘Thank you,’ or they don’t care a rap
what they do say, like Uncle Albert. If he
doesn’t happen to approve of Billy’s <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, he’ll
think nothing of telling Billy to break off——”</p>

<p>“Break off yourself, young woman. You
talk a good deal too much,” put in her brother,
as he rose, big and well-groomed, from the
breakfast-table. “And keep Cariad, will you?
He knows he never follows anyone but his
mistress, but I’ve had to send the station-master’s
boy back with him three times this
week. Good-bye, all.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said I sweetly. “Give my love
to the Near Oriental, especially to the typists’
room, will you? How stuffy it will be getting
there now! How thankful I am for anything
that keeps <em>me</em> out of it on a morning like this!
Still, I suppose one ought not to abuse the place
where we first met.”</p>

<p>This with a glance at him, expressly for
Blanche’s benefit, from under my eyelashes.
For I am acquiring a taste for positively
“baiting” my employer. I’m not going to be
the one made to feel all the awkwardness of the
situation. Not I!</p>

<p>Let <em>him</em> redden with embarrassment before
the guileless remarks or questions that I aim at
him before his mother and sisters. Serve him
right! As for my employer’s feelings towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
me, I have seen them ripening from obliviousness
of my presence, through indifference and dislike,
into positive <em>hatred</em>!</p>

<p>I knew he’d felt the flick of my last remark.
I also knew how he would have liked to retaliate.
Any time since that first evening in the den I
have seen in his eye the yearning to take me by
the shoulders and shake me.</p>

<p>But he said serenely: “It is a glorious morning,
certainly. Too fine not to walk down to
Sevenoaks, so I’m starting a little earlier.”</p>

<p>Good! I thought. I always welcomed the
moment that saw the last, for the whole happy,
idle day, of the only inhabitant of The Lawn
with whom I’m not on excellent terms. Once
<em>he’s</em> out of the house, I can enjoy myself and
forget (almost) why I’m in it.</p>

<p>So it was an annoying shock to me when he
stopped short on his way to the door and added:</p>

<p>“Nancy, do you care to come part of the way
towards the station with me?”</p>

<p>He had me there. I saw there was no
escape. For the first time this week he was
able to check me in having things all my own
way; and, mortified and irritated as I felt, I
could only smile up at him in Manner A, and
reply, all eager delight:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d love it! Give me two minutes to
put on my hat.”</p>

<p>In five minutes—for I knew he’d loads of time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
for his train, and it was still a further turning of
the tables to keep the Governor waiting—I
joined him outside the front door.</p>

<p>Presently we were walking briskly together
down the drive between the green cliffs of
laurel; the air was sweet with the scent of sun-warmed
lilac, the sky was cloudless, the morning
all sunshine—everything, in fact, was as unlike
my own mood as might be.</p>

<p>For I’d guessed that I was “in for” something.
And although I didn’t yet know what
this might be—although it seemed a whole
pre-existence since the day when the prospect of
a few words from the Head of the firm made
his trembling typist feel that the end of all
things was at hand!—I still felt, amongst other
emotions, a little <em>frightened</em>. Again I saw in
my mind that odd, half-amused, half-threatening
stare which the Governor had bent upon me
that first evening when I said good-night at
the door of his den. Supposing I wasn’t able
to keep the reins in my own hands after all?
A new nervousness mingled in me with an
utterly new form of resentment.</p>

<p>I hadn’t long to wait for my few words from
the Governor.</p>

<p>He began—rather to my surprise—without
his traditional “Now, Miss Trant,” but grimly
and stiffly as I don’t suppose Mrs. Waters knows
he can speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Now! There is something I wanted to
say to you. I am sorry to trouble you, but I
am afraid that I have to ask you to be a little
more careful in your manner to me.”</p>

<p>Which of the two manners was he going to
fix upon? The one I reserved for him alone,
or the pretty one that I used to him before
his people?</p>

<p>“My manner? Oh!” I turned a dismayed
face, the face of a typist caught out in some
careless mistake, up to his as we walked along.
“I am afraid I don’t quite know what you
mean.”</p>

<p>“You do,” said his face.</p>

<p>But he only said concisely: “I mean the
tone you sometimes feel called upon to adopt
towards me, as just now, at breakfast. Of
course when we are alone you must please yourself
entirely. But that will hardly do before
others.”</p>

<p>Ah, it was for Manner A, then, that he’d
settled to take me to task. So none of it had
been lost upon him, then; none of the unearthly
sweetness hiding home-thrusts that only he was
able to recognize as such! None of the elaborate
ways in which I’ve been pretending to think of
little things to please him; quoting (in public)
bits of his songs that I call my favourites,
picking a sulphur-coloured pansy—that he daren’t
<em>not</em> wear!—for his button-hole, then making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
him take it out to let me change it for a leaf
of scented geranium, because there were table
decorations of those at the Savoy “the day
we lunched there before you chose my ring;
do you remember?” I hope he’ll never cease
to remember <em>and to regret</em> “that day!”</p>

<p>For the whole nature of the grudge I have
against him has changed in these few days.
The thoughts have gone into the background
of all that office drudgery and Near Oriental
unpleasantness. I’ve forgotten that I used to
hate him as part of a life of being ordered about
on a few shillings a week. But when, in accepting
this invitation to a house of luxury and leisure,
I had the feeling of “coming home” to my
old sort of life, I hadn’t realized how many of
the feelings belonging to that by-gone life
were going to wake up again inside me, indignantly
ashamed. I was my father’s daughter.
I was well accustomed to the ease and space and
comforts of such a house as The Lawn—the
Waters don’t suspect that, but I <em>was</em> born to
them. I wasn’t born, however, to taking up
the position in such a house which he has forced
upon me. Dully simmering in my mind, for
some time now, has been the thought of this
slight which he has put upon me, this insult.</p>

<p>This was the thought that softened my voice
into the timid and suppressed “office” key,
which I felt I couldn’t keep up very much longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Have I been saying and doing the wrong
things before your people then? I am sorry!”</p>

<p>I hoped my voice was not going to run away
with me, but I heard myself beginning to lose
control over that serviceable meekness as I
went on.</p>

<p>“It is rather difficult for me, you know.
Still, I did think I <em>seemed</em> everything that your
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> ought to be! I have been trying——”</p>

<p>“You have,” admitted Mr. Waters grimly.
“Very.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean I <em>haven’t</em> been a success,
then?” I heard myself demanding quickly.
“Oh! Because, if I don’t give satisfaction——”</p>

<p>I stopped. It wasn’t my place to finish the
sentence with “I had better give notice!”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said my employer curtly. “I see.”</p>

<p>Did he “see,” I wondered? Did he realize
that, though I was bound hand and foot by that
absurd muddle of an agreement, he might break
it when he chose, and that I was longing, desperately,
for him to do so then and there?</p>

<p>“It’s very hard,” I explained as evenly as I
could, hoping that this explanation would give
him his cue, “hard to manage to hit the right
note always, and to have to decide every minute
upon the way I should naturally behave if I
really <em>were</em> engaged; Of course <em>I’m</em> under
contract, but——”</p>

<p>Here, very suddenly and unexpectedly, Still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Waters broke out into a tone I’d never heard
from him before. He positively “let himself
go” as he lashed out with his walking-stick at
an inoffensive dock-leaf in the hedge-row we
were passing, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“By Jove! I’d pity any man who was
‘really engaged’ to <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>Ah! So I had got him to speak his mind at
last, his own mind that he would have given
anything not to have revealed to any employee!
More than that, I’d driven him into being
inexcusably rude to a woman. His face, where
the tan had deepened to a sullen red, his lips,
compressed into what seemed like a thin, pen-drawn
line, showed me that <em>he</em> had realized
this. <em>I</em> don’t mean him to forget what he said.
I said nothing. The most awkward of all the
many awkward pauses so far, elapsed between
us as we walked along, and before he spoke again.
When he did, I saw that it cost him more than
he liked me to notice.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see—I ought not to have said
that. I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Please don’t! I didn’t mind it at
all,” said I, better able to speak very sweetly
now that I felt I had regained some of my
ascendancy. But all the fun of “scoring” off
him had gone, though I must not let him see
that. “Of course you’ve every right to say
exactly what you think, just as Theo does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>For his face, still flushed, ruffled, and without
a trace of the “office-mask,” wore a fleeting
but quite laughable likeness to his youngest
sister’s. I have heard it said of some girl, “She
isn’t pretty exactly, but she has pretty looks,”
and positively, if I didn’t dislike him so intensely,
I should say that the Governor, though never
handsome, has “handsome looks” himself.</p>

<p>I went on, still mildly: “Only, you know,
Theo and Blanche and your mother don’t
happen to think—what you’ve just said. They
seem to consider that—well! that the man I
was engaged to isn’t—wouldn’t be at all to be
<em>pitied</em>!”</p>

<p>“I know. You needn’t tell me that. You
have contrived to make all three of them ridic—extremely
fond of you!” This resentfully,
realizing it as part of my insolence to him.
“My mother and the girls don’t see through
it, when you are—are covertly reminding me,
in a hundred small ways, of what I don’t need
to be reminded of. <em>That</em> would be all right,
therefore—only——Other people who came
to the house might not be so unsuspecting
<em>They</em> might chance to notice that there was
something odd—unusual—unnatural in your
attitude to me.”</p>

<p>“But—but you said any strangeness would
be put down to the awkwardness of a girl so
recently engaged?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“No one would give <em>you</em> much credit for
being ‘awkward!’” Still more resentfully.
“And something might come out. That is
why I am obliged to ask you to be a little more
guarded.”</p>

<p>“‘More guarded,’” I repeated meekly, like
a child who is learning by heart. “Yes. I
must. I must try harder to make it seem less
‘unnatural’ that we two should be engaged.”</p>

<p>Again the look, instantly banished, that meant
he pined to shake me.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>

<p>“And by the ‘other people,’ I suppose you
mean this other—outspoken Mr. Waters who
is coming over to ‘inspect’ me? Do you
think—are you afraid that <em>he</em> will be sorry for
the man who is supposed to be engaged to me?”</p>

<p>Under his breath Mr. William Waters muttered
what <em>sounded</em>, at least, like the one word, “IMP!”</p>

<p>I heard him.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only the first syllable of the
word “Impertinence!”</p>

<p>At all events, I heard that distinctly. And
though it meant I <em>had</em> scored another point
and made His Imperturbability forget himself
yet again, I couldn’t enjoy the triumph of it,
nor even laugh to myself. There had been too
much of all this.... I was suddenly tired.
Tears, of fatigue, I suppose, rushed unexpectedly
into my eyes, and I was obliged to turn my head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
and glare over the hedge at a may-tree in full
bloom that became a dancing blur of pink.</p>

<p><em>He</em> was pretending that he hadn’t begun to
speak at all. He began again, stiffly:</p>

<p>“My uncle and another man are coming
over to-night. This uncle of mine is eccentric
in some ways, but extremely shrewd; and no—er—two-edged
sort of remark would be lost
on him.”</p>

<p>“I see,” I said, blinking angrily at the next
may-tree, but still controlling my voice. “I
had better not make <em>any</em> sort of remark at all
then, before him. I could be too shy to open
my lips. In fact, just as I am—used to be, at
the office. Would that be better?”</p>

<p>“Distinctly better than—er—recent methods,”
said the Governor dryly. “This other man is
merely a business acquaintance with whom I
hope to have dealings. So——”</p>

<p>“You want him to be favourably impressed,”
I concluded intelligently, “with your <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>
and all your other belongings.”</p>

<p>“If you choose to put it so. But——”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“Above all,” said the Governor, “I don’t, on
this particular occasion, don’t want to be made
to look a <em>fool</em>!”</p>

<p>It came out quite boyishly and slangily, and
for a moment I could almost have liked Still
Waters for that. Then—yes! I thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
savagely, he mustn’t be allowed to look a fool
even for once, but I may go on looking a fool
and worse, for the next year! And then I saw
that he was inwardly rating himself for having,
as he considered, played into the enemy’s hands—having
allowed me to see exactly when and where
I could get the better of him next.</p>

<p>He didn’t trust me.</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” I said, softly and bitterly.
Let him suppose, if he chose, that I meant doing
my best to let him look a fool before his uncle
and his pompous fine business acquaintance,
indeed. What would he amount to, I wondered,
this acquaintance of the Governor’s for
whom I, Monica Trant, was to be on my best
behaviour? Probably someone Father wouldn’t
have had in the house!</p>

<p>We reached the turning to the station and I
stopped.</p>

<p>“Was there anything else that you wished to
speak to me about?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said my employer at his
curtest. “That was all. Good-morning!”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat; his face beneath it was
set with temper. Good! Let him vent it on
Mr. Dundonald at the office!</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” I said, and turned away.
I was glad that there had been no one in the lane
to see that parting; to anyone who had watched,
knowing who that tall, blonde, savage-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
man was who had said good-morning so frigidly
to that small girl with her head held in a very
straight line with her back, it would have looked
so ludicrously like the last thing in the world
that it really was—a lover’s quarrel!</p>

<p>How furiously he had marched off! I turned
round, after walking on a few yards, to catch
another glimpse of that stampede.</p>

<p>Then I was sorry.</p>

<p>For at that very moment he had elected to
turn round and see me!</p>

<p>It just shows that people are quite right to
teach children <em>never</em> to turn round on the road.</p>

<p>I wish I hadn’t!</p>

<span class="smaller">“THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS”</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Nancy! I say, Nancy! Here’s Billy and
this new man of his turned up <em>hours</em>
before we expected them, and mother’s out
calling somewhere, and Blanche is in the middle
of washing her hair, and just look at the awful
rip I’ve made in my frock; <em>I</em> can’t come!”
announced Theo in a voice subdued almost to
a stage whisper when I met her on the stairs
this afternoon. “So <em>you</em> be a saint and go in
and talk pretty to the visitor till tea, will you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” I laughed; and passed on to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was cool and dim in there after the sunshine
of the garden, where I had been lazing over a
book and forgetting this morning’s stress, and
for a moment my eyes could scarcely make out
the two figures that stood with their backs to
the white-curtained French windows.</p>

<p>Then, beside the Governor’s tall bulk, I saw
a small, dapper, masculine silhouette with a
rather too abrupt “pinch-in” at the waist of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
its coat, and a perky, quick turn of the head;
the general effect of Mr. Cyril Maude in some
military part that I had once seen. Was it
this that seemed so familiar, I wondered?</p>

<p>A monocle fell with a click against a waistcoat-button;
then, as I came forward, a voice, also
vaguely familiar, cried in amazement:</p>

<p>“Monica Trant! Little Monica! Well, <em>I</em>
am blessed!”</p>

<p>Who in the world was this that knew my name?
I looked harder at him. Surely it—Was
it?—yes! it <em>was</em> one of father’s old friends,
Major Montresor. So <em>this</em> was my employer’s
“business acquaintance.” I felt myself trying
not to stare. The Governor, I know, was staring
undisguisedly at the pair of us.</p>

<p>“Why, bless my soul, Monica! Who’d have
expected to see <em>you</em> coming in like this?”</p>

<p>“Or you, Major Montresor?” I retorted,
obliged to smile at him as I held out my hand
to his always tenacious clasp.</p>

<p>To be frank, I can’t say I was at all pleased
that the Governor’s visitor had turned out to
be someone who’d seen me so often in the old
days. I don’t want those days to be mixed up
with these. Already a ghost or so out of those
days had seemed inclined to come and haunt
the lovely garden and the big, comfortable rooms
at The Lawn! And now I seemed to see
a regular Richard-the-Third-like procession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
those ghosts rising up behind the little Major’s
trimly-waisted figure—people with whom I’d
associated last time he’d seen me—standing in
judgment, echoing his “Who’d have expected
to see <em>you</em>?”—adding their phantom stares to
those of the two men whose eyes were actually
upon me. It was tiresome; might mean all
sorts of adaptations; even the assumption of
a “Manner C” for the benefit of Major Montresor!
As for him, he’s a rather amusing,
tactless, talkative, would-be-man-of-the-world
sort of person, who’d been quite ready to get up
what Kipling calls the “You’re-only-a-little-girl
type of flirtation” with me when I was
seventeen or so. I hadn’t met him since, nor
had I wanted to; though I had been distinctly
interested, five years ago, to find that someone
who possessed medals and a moustache cared to
talk to me while I was still in the school-room.
He’d got to look ever so much older since then,
balder, stiffer of movement in his slim boots and
his stays—I beg his pardon, I expect he called
it his belt—and, apparently, more flirtatious
than ever!</p>

<p>Now, any <em>woman</em> over thirty-five has to be
fairly attractive before she’s allowed to flirt on
without fear of ridicule. But a <em>man</em> at fifty,
or fifty-five, seems to claim the right to monopolize
the prettiest and youngest girl he meets.
It doesn’t matter if he hasn’t a hair on his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
or a tooth of his own in it. As long as he’s single
and wears trousers, he’s an eligible bachelor—or
so he thinks. A mercy he doesn’t hear the
ideas of the favoured girl on this subject!</p>

<p>So, quite unsuspectingly, Major Montresor
beamed upon me, and declared at least three
times that this was a most <em>delightful</em> surprise,
upon his word!—seeming almost to forget
his host, who stood a little aside, looking utterly
disconcerted, as far as I could see without turning
my eyes, to discover that this “business acquaintance”
knew his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> better than
her employer ever could!</p>

<p>Christian names, too!</p>

<p>“Monica—Bless my soul, what’s this?”</p>

<p>“This” was an interruption that precipitated
itself through the unlatched French window;
a small white dog that bore in his mouth a large
bone, noisome-smelling and of the earth, earthy,
which he dumped upon the Major’s japanned
boot.</p>

<p>“<em>Cariad!</em>” growled the Governor, more
angrily than I’d ever heard him speak except to
me, “what do you <em>mean</em>? Here, sir.” He
grabbed him by the collar, kicking the bone
violently over the shallow sill in front of him.
“Sorry, I shall have to get the little brute locked
up.” And he dragged the cheerfully resigned
Cariad out and along the gravel to the back of
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Decent sort of young fellow, Waters;
very clever business-man; useful to know;
quite a nice chap, too,” commented the little
Major, lowering his voice as he turned to me.
“But, my dear child”—he always used the word
“child” to excuse his gesture while he patted my
shoulder, or smoothed my lace collar, or played
with my silver chain—“my child, how <em>did</em> you
come to be here?”</p>

<p>“I am staying with Mrs. Waters”—demurely.</p>

<p>“Well, well! So you knew them! Your
poor father didn’t, did he? You were at school
with the girls of the house, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No. I met Mr. Waters”—still more demurely—“in
business.”</p>

<p>“Business? Upon my word! Glad you’ve
got such a business-adviser. Glad you’re in the
position to need one, Monica. I heard rumours
of your poor father having left you not very well
off. Odd how these untrue bits of gossip get
about!”—with an experienced eye upon the
expensive new afternoon frock of my preferred
pink, with its creamy ruffle, black velvet bow, and
small paste buckle. “You look the picture of
prosperity and health and good looks, if you’ll
allow an old friend to say so?”</p>

<p>Well, one simply <em>has</em> to “allow” things to
people who call themselves “old.” But for
that, how many “old friends” would have
received the order of “Paws off!” or “No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
patting, please,” or a more politely expressed
equivalent from the girls who can’t be rude to
their father’s contemporaries?</p>

<p>I was only just about to draw my hand away
from another long and tender squeeze of Major
Montresor’s, when his host came back to us.
Through the French window, as the Governor
pushed it open, a ray of sunlight caught and blazed
on the magnificent diamonds of the ring which
had been bought at Gemmer’s for me to wear.</p>

<p>Instantly Major Montresor pounced on that
other hand.</p>

<p>“Hal-lo! What’s this? It isn’t——?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, sedately.</p>

<p>“Little Monica engaged?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come, not really, what? No! You don’t
say so, really?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must, Major Montresor.”</p>

<p>“By—Jove! And I never heard! Here’s
a blow!” He sighed tempestuously. “Well!
Youth will be served! Fortunate youth!” he
prattled on without a break. “I’m sure he’s to
be congratulated, the dog. Always hanging
round you in the old days, I remember. Yes!
Cultured sort of young Johnny with a beard—what
was his name, now? Ah, I have it—Vandeleur,
of course, young Sydney Vandeleur!”</p>

<p>Pleasant for me, wasn’t it? To have this
voice from the Past blurting out—less tactful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
even than Cicely!—the name of the lover I had
lost. In a flash I saw my employer’s slight movement—saw
by the passing look on his face that
his “business-man’s memory,” which never forgets
a name, had instantly associated that of
“Vandeleur” with those people at the Carlton
to whom I’d first introduced my “<i lang="fr">fiancé</i>.”
What must he imagine? Still, that wasn’t the
point. The point was that he should explain
to this gossiping little Major, as quickly as
possible, how things really—I mean officially,
stood! To my horror he didn’t speak. There
was an agonizing pause. I shot a glance at the
Governor.... Heavens! He, of all people,
seemed utterly at a loss—fidgeting like a schoolboy;
he who could “break the news” to his
staff at the office without turning a hair, was
leaving it all, here, apparently to <em>me</em>!</p>

<p>Well!</p>

<p>Hurriedly I was beginning:</p>

<p>“But, Major Montresor——” when the drawing-room
door opened to the entrance of Mrs.
Waters, in her soft grey satin wrap and black
picture hat; Cariad, liberated and tail-wagging,
in her wake.</p>

<p>Greetings were exchanged—what talk followed
I scarcely heard, until the gentle voice of the
Governor’s mother exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! Then you had met my son’s <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Fiancée?</i>” echoed Major Montresor. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
monocle dropped again, so did his jaw. I never
saw a man so utterly, so comically taken aback.
He wheeled abruptly, to stare from me to the
Governor, then back to his hostess again.
“Your son’s? Am I to understand that it is
<em>he</em> who is engaged to Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>Here at last the Governor did find his tongue.</p>

<p>“I have that honour,” he said, clearing his
throat, taking a step forward, and looking down
at the little Major just as some tawny Great
Dane might have looked at Cariad—but no!
No big dog can ever look as utterly silly—there’s
no other word for it—as a man who doesn’t
know what to say next. And he who had, it
appeared, particularly wished to avoid being made
to look a fool on this occasion—Well! He must
admit that it was none of <em>my</em> doing that he stood
there looking like that!</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! I suppose I shall have to
grin and bear it and congratulate you, Waters,”
rattled off Major Montresor. “I certainly <em>do</em>
congratulate you!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t feel <em>sorry</em> for you,” I added mentally,
hoping the unspoken comment showed in the
one glance I allowed myself to steal at my employer
as I crossed over to sit on the low chintz
couch beside his mother, while the visitor talked
on.</p>

<p>“Still, you might have prepared me for this,
my dear fellow. You might have given your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
heart-broken rival some warning. Let me down
a bit gently, eh? about how you were robbing
me of the one girl I’d hoped might solace my
declining years. Met Miss Trant, Mrs. Waters?
Bless my life, rather! Used to billet myself for
months at Colonel Trant’s house in the old days—ripping
old place it was, too; gorgeous beech
avenue; lawn something like your own here,
but sweeping away down to the river—oh, ripping!
What’s become of the place now, Miss
Monica; let, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Sold,” I said, shortly.</p>

<p>Without looking up from the patch of carpet
on which Missis’s little dog slumbered with his
muzzle resting against my shoe, I could feel the
change that came into my employer’s grey
glance—the half-disconcerted “M’m. News to
<em>me</em>, all this!” expression that just flicked across
his face. His mother’s hand made a little movement
towards mine—and for some reason I felt
that she was a little sorry.... I was furious!
Why on earth couldn’t this little he-gossip—though
why they should understand by the
word “gossip” an old woman, I never <em>shall</em> know—why
couldn’t he allow these people to go on
thinking that the typist her employer had chosen
to honour had never been before inside any sort
of house but one of a row of seventy or eighty, all
with the same sort of pot-plants hiding what lay
beyond the Nottingham lace curtained windows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
with the same neat front door, and the same
metaphorical wolf crouched grimly in front of it!
Desperately I wished that something might
suddenly deprive Major Montresor of the power
of speech, only I suppose nothing ever could
do <em>that</em>!</p>

<p>Evidently he wasn’t going to spare me anything.
I was to stand full in the limelight of
other days.</p>

<p>“Hope the new tenants will keep it up as they
should, then, that’s all”—genially. “They took
on the fishing with it, I suppose? ‘Everything
went together.’ What? I see. Hope they’ll
take as much pride as your poor father did in
those magnificent hot-houses of his. Ah, I’ve
never tasted peaches like those, anywhere else!
Remember how you used to race me down to
get the finest peach before breakfast, Monica?
Yes, hang it all, I think I shall have to ask your
leave to go on calling her that, Waters. Loved
her from childhood’s hour, y’see. Her childhood’s,
not mine, of course!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured the Governor.</p>

<p>Miss Robinson would have been kept in high
spirits for the next week by that “Oh.”</p>

<p>It didn’t amuse <em>me</em> much as I sat there, carrying
out to the letter my promise to say nothing and
look shy. I was feeling at least as embarrassed
as I looked by the time tea was brought in and
the girls made their appearance; Blanche with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
her fair hair unmanageably soft from its washing;
Theo, as usual, all eyes for the visitor. I hoped
they might distract his attention from me—they’re
quite young enough!—but no! All
the time he was sipping his tea and munching
slice after slice of cake, the little Major continued
to pour out comment after embarrassing comment
upon my affairs, addressing himself chiefly now
to the Governor.</p>

<p><em>He</em> sat looking still more hopelessly uncomfortable
and bigger than ever in contrast to the
frail china tea-cup and the slice of wafer-like
bread-and-butter in his clutch. Why do people
allow men in at drawing-room teas? Why
couldn’t those two have been having theirs in
the billiard-room—the garage—<em>anywhere</em>—where
I could have been saved from Major Montresor’s
relentless flow of conversation?</p>

<p>“And to think I should have known you all
these months without suspecting that your gain
was to be my loss—no, no, I don’t mean the business
part of it, my boy. I mean this engagement
of yours, ha, ha! And then—funny thing!
to be congratulating the wrong man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>were</em> you?” burst suddenly, irrepressibly,
from Theo, unable to check the following
“Who?”</p>

<p>“Theo-<em>dora</em>, dear!”</p>

<p>“Ah, never mind, never mind!” took up the
little Major, turning quickly to the child and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
smiling from her to me. “I don’t tell tales out
of school, young lady. But brown eyes”—with
another monocled glance at those wide
search-lights under the yellow curls—“brown
eyes always stand for fickleness! There must
have been a dozen at least of us that you treated
disgracefully, Monica, eh? One comfort is
I’m not the <em>only</em> sufferer!”</p>

<p>He was not!</p>

<p>My heart sank lower and lower at the thought
that this garrulous little blunderer was to stay
for dinner. And the other expected guest, the
outspoken uncle, was to be here for the whole
week-end! What would <em>he</em> be like? Not worse
than Major Montresor—that was the single ray
of comfort. Nothing <em>could</em> be worse! Still,
the two together—what a prospect!</p>

<p>Even as I was shuddering over it, the sound of
some confused commotion was borne in to us
from the hall; and then a loud, bluff, breezy
voice positively shouted:</p>

<p>“Name? My good woman, you’re pretty
new to this house, or you’d know my name.
Same as your master’s. No! Don’t announce
me. I’ll announce myself.” (As if this were
necessary!) “Where are they all? Tea?
Good! Young lady there too? Excellent!”</p>

<p>The door, this time, burst open, and in
<em>avalanched</em> (it’s the only word) Uncle Albert
Waters.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORDEAL BY INSPECTION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In looks, Uncle Albert Waters was just like
the John Bull of the cartoons, minus the hat.
In voice, he was Theo through a megaphone.
In manner, a genial form of hurricane.</p>

<p>“Now then, now then! How’s everybody?”
he blared. “Mary! Blanche! Theo!” (An
explosive kiss to each.) “Ha! Billy, my
boy!” (A violent blow on the shoulder.)
“Major Montresor, glad to see you again—how
are you? Still defying the enemy?
Splendid!” (A pump-handle shake of the
hand.) “Now, Billy!” turning again to my
employer. “You needn’t introduce <em>me</em> to your
sweetheart. She knows who I am, and what
I’ve come for. What I want is to have a good
look at <em>her</em>. Young lady,” to me, “will you be
kind enough to oblige an old man whose eyesight’s
not quite what it was, by turning full
to the light?”</p>

<p>I did. What else could I do?</p>

<p>I sat, facing the low flood of late afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sunshine, and feeling without seeing that all
the others turned a little away from me, while
Uncle Albert fixed his prominent, honest grey
eyes upon my face and stared at it without
reserve for—well! it seemed several of the
longest minutes I’d ever known. Then judgment
was pronounced.</p>

<p>“Well done, Billy!” Here there would
have been another of those heavy blows upon
the Governor’s broad shoulder, but he had
edged away. “You’ve chosen well, boy. A
bonnie girl, and a well-bred one, and one to do
you credit. Now, Mary, I’m ready for that tea.
And, you, my dear”—meaning me—“pass me
the bread and butter. What’s your name,
now?”</p>

<p>“My full name is Monica,” I said for the
benefit of Major Montresor who had fixed the
monocle with something like mild indignation
upon the last comer. “They call me Nancy,
here.”</p>

<p>“Nancy. A pretty name for a pretty girl,
appropriate, too. ‘<i>All my fancy dwells upon
Nancy</i>’—eh, William? You used to sing that
song once upon a time, dare say you haven’t
forgotten it, now?”</p>

<p>And so on, and so forth. I really don’t know
how much more of it there was before the
dreadful old man had finished his ample tea and
was carried off to his room by the Governor in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
much the same humour, I thought, as he had
dragged Cariad and his bone to the back of
the house.</p>

<p>A pity Uncle Albert Waters couldn’t be
locked up in the tool-house!</p>

<p>I felt like murder when I reached my pretty
room at last. What a day it had been! It
had seemed forty-eight hours long at least.
Beginning with that horrible walk to the station
with the Governor—Then there had been the
unwelcome appearance of Major Montresor and
his clumsy blunderings, first about Sydney and
secondly about the old times at home—and
now this terrible old Uncle turning up to
inspect and blare out his embarrassing verdict
upon my looks and suitability; oh, it’s the last
straw!</p>

<p>It’s the worst that’s happened yet! There
<em>can</em> be nothing to beat the Governor’s Uncle
at tea, even though the evening isn’t yet over.
I feel as if it were long past bed-time, and there’s
only half an hour or so before dressing for
dinner! Even half an hour alone——</p>

<p>But I haven’t been allowed a minute of it
alone.</p>

<p>The girls fluttered into my room almost as
soon as I came up; brimful of sympathy, but
not sympathetic enough to keep themselves from
laughter.</p>

<p>“Poor dear Nancy! Wasn’t it awful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you Uncle Albert was a terror?
But you don’t think he really <em>talks</em> like me,
Nancy, do you? Billy <em>will</em> say he <em>does</em>!”</p>

<p>“Theo! He can <em>easily</em> hear you from his
room, and the window’s open. Oh, I do hope
that when I’m engaged my young man won’t
have <em>quite</em> such loud relations!”</p>

<p>“Better than having deceitful whispery voices
and saying horrid things in them about you
behind your back,” retorted Theo. “And
anyhow, Uncle Albert did <em>like</em> her!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Blanche, deprecatingly, “but
isn’t it nearly as terrible as if he disapproved?”</p>

<p>“It’s <em>worse</em>,” I decided to myself as I dressed
for dinner, in my white, to please Theo, who
apparently has some mysterious child’s reason
for wanting me to wear that particular frock
to-night. “Even if one were madly in love,
a relation like that would be quite enough to
make one wonder if it were worth it! Yes!
Even if one were <em>really</em> engaged to be married
to a man—the man Mr. Waters would ‘pity,’
one would break it off rather than put up with
such an uncle-in-law. Well! Thank goodness
I’m spared <em>that</em> at all events! I hope
Uncle Albert won’t pay many of his visits of
inspection during the next year. One or two
ought to be enough for him, and I’ve taken the
plunge now,” thought I, “and got it over. He
can’t go on being much more awful at dinner!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THEO SITS UP</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Yes! It was all of a piece with the fiascoes
of the day that my little watch gained
ten minutes, hurrying me through my dressing
and down, before I’d any need for such haste,
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Here, big and black-and-white against the
giant pink roses of the chintz couch, I found
(as I needn’t have hoped not to find, on this
day of <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>!) my employer alone.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, of course, and wheeled
forward a chair for me (looking as if he wished
he could have pushed it and me through the
French windows and out of the house for ever!—Goodness
knows I reciprocated that wish!)
and I sat down.</p>

<p>Then ensued what I’m beginning to call to
myself “one of our pauses.”</p>

<p>But I felt that this evening my nerves wouldn’t
stand silence—that nothing could float me over
these quicksands of awkwardness but an unceasing
ripple of small-talk. If <em>he</em> wouldn’t,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
I must say something; anything! The first
thing that came into my head!</p>

<p>“H—how close it is! Do you think there
will be thunder to-night?”</p>

<p>There was suppressed thunder enough on his
face as he answered politely: “It is getting
rather stifling. Perhaps you would like the
window open?” and he rose and walked across
to it.</p>

<p>Then, from under the chintz valance of the
couch where he’d been sitting, there emerged at
small and cringing form with an enormous
white satin bow tied to his collar.</p>

<p>“Poor Cariad!” I went on, patting the
unusually subdued little dog, “you <em>have</em> got a
smart new tie! Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>A one-sided conversation didn’t meet the
case, so the “dumb animal” (as they call it)
gave me the cue for my next remark to the
almost equally dumb human being.</p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to know where he got
his rather curious name,” I said. “What <em>does</em>
it mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s Welsh,” explained my employer
abruptly, still standing by the open window.
“It means ‘Sweetheart’”—if you must know,
his tone concluded.</p>

<p>“Oh.... Is he a Welsh terrier?”</p>

<p>“We got him from Wales. From a little
place in Anglesey where my people sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
go for the summer holidays,” my employer
vouchsafed, with an effort. “Porth Cariad
the name of it is—‘Port Sweetheart.’”</p>

<p>“Fancy calling a <em>place</em> that!” I took up,
with the one idea of keeping this conversation
from coming to a dead stop. “But some people
call <em>anything</em> that!” (I was wondering inwardly
what this last remark could possibly mean
even as I went on.) “Is it by the sea?”</p>

<p>“Er—I think so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; ports generally are, of course....
Is it—is it a <em>pretty</em> place at all?”</p>

<p>“Quite. It hasn’t been spoilt yet. Charming
little bay. The usual sort of thing.” (Pause.)</p>

<p>“Yes—? <em>Do</em> tell me about it!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know—There are about
two cottages. No end of gorse—heather.”</p>

<p>“How lovely!” Then, scenting another
pause, I hurried on—“Isn’t there anything <em>else</em>
there?”</p>

<p>“Well—There’s a sort of woman.”</p>

<p>“A woman? Really? How interesting!
What sort of a woman?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a <em>wooden</em> one,” returned the Governor,
who was too obviously thinking about something
else. A wooden woman! What <em>could</em> he mean
by it? But before I could begin my next
question the door opened; the Governor turned
quickly, then, seeing who came in, he exclaimed
in accents of concentrated disgust:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Theo! Isn’t it time you were in bed?”</p>

<p>“No! Because I’m not going! I’m going
to sit up for dinner, just for this once!” announced
the child, triumphantly advancing upon
us in a Prize-Day “effect” of let-down white
skirts and long, cream-silk-stockinged legs. “I
asked Mother, and that nice old man” (Poor
Major Montresor!) “begged her to let me, and
I may! So there! Nancy, <em>don’t</em> you like the
way I’ve done my hair for it?”</p>

<p>She had tied a fillet of white satin—a bit of
the same ribbon which was disconcerting Cariad—about
her short curls.</p>

<p>“What’s that for? To keep your brains
from bursting through?” demanded her brother
crossly. But Theodora only tossed that yellow
posy of a head of hers, retorting that Major
Montresor thought she was sixteen, and was
going to sit next her, and that there would be a
<em>surprise</em> at dinner!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>The surprise—or the series of surprises—didn’t
dawn upon me in its full hideousness all
at once.</p>

<p>In the dim-shaded dining-room, where the
tall maids flitted noiselessly to and from the
hatch at one end, the round table about which
the seven of us sat down seemed, with its
many candles in the curving arms of Sheffield<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
candlesticks, its gleaming white porcelain, and
its winking, patterned array of silver and cut
glass, like some great oasis of softly-radiant
light. Upon it, as table-centre, there was set
the silver-bordered pool of an oval mirror,
reflecting a large silver goblet, round which I
could read part of the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">1896<br />
FIFTY YARDS SWIM——<br />
SECS. 6——<br />
W. WAT——</p>

<p class="noindent">that upheld a pyramid of creamy, perfumed
blossom, softened with sprays of feathery white.
Budding spikes of the same blossom were massed
about the pedestals of four little winged Loves,
offering baskets that held tiny bouquets of the
white sprays, mingled with chocolates wrapped
up in silver-foil. Gradually but surely I realized
the effect of all this decoration; it was indescribably,
unmistakably, blatantly—<em>bridal</em>!</p>

<p>And then I realized who was responsible for
it. That gift of Heaven, Theodora, was beaming
upon her handiwork.</p>

<p>It must have been her innocent hands, too,
that had tied up each table-napkin with a white
bow and a spray of buds; had cut silver-paper
out of a chocolate-box into the miniature
horseshoes that lay strewn negligently but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
broadcast all over the tablecloth; and had
encircled the place where I sat with a wreath
of crystallized rose-leaves in the shape of a heart.</p>

<p>With one frantic sweep of my hand I brushed
these last into the table-napkin on my lap. I
must pretend I’d noticed nothing, and then
(though I knew that thunder-cloud was deepening
every moment on the Governor’s brow)
perhaps the others really <em>wouldn’t</em> notice!</p>

<p>Vain hope!</p>

<p>It was dashed even before the two usually
so sedate maids, who seemed, this evening, to
emanate some subtle atmosphere of sympathy
and giggle, had finished handing round the soup.</p>

<p>“Dear me! Who arranged the flowers like
this?” murmured Mrs. Waters, with a mildly
bewildered glance at this white-and-silver
display. “I thought Blanche was going to
have just the little crystal tubs with the pink
Maman Cochets and some maidenhair fern?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mumsie, I was. But Theo <em>would</em> put
white heather and syringa!”</p>

<p>“Because—Oh, can’t you see <em>why?</em>” broke
in the cornet voice of the youngest of the family,
who sat between me and the Major.</p>

<p>And before anyone could answer or check
her, this appalling child went on to give chapter
and verse for each of her enormities.</p>

<p>“It’s because, you see, syringa’s so awfully
like orange-blossoms!—They call it ‘mock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
orange!’ And I meant it for Billy and
Nancy!”</p>

<p>She paused for breath (so did everybody else),
then she hurried on.</p>

<p>“Yes! I did the table, because I wanted it
to be appropriate! So I took away those
everyday bon-bon dishes and fetched out these
little china Cupids to hold the choc’lates
instead! <em>Aren’t</em> they ducky?”</p>

<p>No one responded, but every eye was upon
Theo, who took it all for approval and beamed
again, enlarging upon her arrangements.</p>

<p>“And that’s why I got Nancy to put on her
white satin”—</p>

<p>(<em>Ah!</em>)</p>

<p>—“with those lace lilies round her front, so’s
she could look more like a <em>bride</em>!”</p>

<p>(What I did look like at that moment I don’t
know. But the Governor couldn’t have looked
more like the executioner in a cloak-and-dagger
film drama.)</p>

<p>“And <em>do</em> you see the confetti, of those teeny
silver horseshoes, and the pink rose-leaves
strewn over—Oh, Nancy!”—reproachfully—“<em>Look</em>
what’s happened to the Heart! And
that was supposed to be Billy’s!”</p>

<p>Here I saw the mouth of Uncle Albert, who
was sitting facing me at Mrs. Waters’ right
hand, open in readiness for that approving
bellow of his. “Never mind, I’ll make another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
I <em>wanted</em> to do it all like this the first evening
she came down,” explained Theo further.
“Only, of course, we weren’t quite sure then
whether she’d like it—”</p>

<p>(<em>Like</em> it!)</p>

<p>—“but it <em>was</em> all my idea!”</p>

<p><em>Then</em> came the bellow of laughter, and—“A
jolly good idea too, Kiddie!” from the other of
my employer’s “loud relations,” his odious
uncle. “Very pretty, Theo!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought it would be rather sweet!
Doesn’t <em>Billy</em>?” said the child, with a half-defiant
look towards the Head of the House,
who looked—there is no denying it—as if he
were longing to kick someone. He <em>did</em> kick—a
smothered yelp from under the table told me
what. He had vented some of his feelings upon
the little dog whose name meant “Sweetheart”
in Welsh—who came from that port—one of
those by the sea! where there are two cottages
and a wooden woman—whatever that meant!
The taller of the parlour-maids, handing lobster
<i lang="fr">soufflé</i> to her master, wasn’t wooden enough,
nor quick enough in repressing her smile.</p>

<p>A glare of reproof was her portion as he
refused the dish, and a peremptory, “Move that—er—thing.
It’s in the way!” with a jerk
towards the silver pot that held the spraying
conservatory plant.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh</em>, what a shame!” protested Theo loudly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
as this emblem was borne away. “And I’d
specially <em>put</em> it so that it <em>shouldn’t</em> be in his way
when he wanted to look at Nancy!”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Comes there much more of it?</i>’” I quoted
to myself, but I caught Major Montresor’s eye;
he was looking puzzled, almost sorry for me!
And that nerved me up to laughing (I flatter
myself, quite naturally!) as I murmured to Theo
that she was a sentimental little goose!</p>

<p>“Sentimental? A good thing if she is!”
took up Theo’s irrepressible uncle. “I like it.
In these highly-educated days it’s a good sign!
Yes, I like to see the young folks still taking
an interest in watching a real Romance, instead
of stuffing up their heads with nothing but
mixed hockey and hunger-strikes and rubbish
of that sort! That never brought a girl a sweetheart
yet, <em>did</em> it, Mary? <em>Does</em> it, Nancy?
And that’s all a girl’s there for, when you get
down to bedrock. I may be a bit behind the
times——”</p>

<p>As he was the only person talking at the
table, he was considerably “behind” with his
dinner. Unheeding, he discoursed on all through
the <i lang="fr">entrée</i> and the saddle of mutton.</p>

<p>“Yes! I may be hackneyed and old-fashioned,
but that’s what I feel. What do you say,
Major?”</p>

<p>What chance had the Major of saying
anything? The whole conversation had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
pretty equally divided between the two <i lang="fr">enfants
terribles</i>—the girl of thirteen and the man of
sixty.</p>

<p>“Plenty of Romance in our young days!
All over for us now! Still, we enjoy seeing
the rising generation keep it up! Good luck to
’em. White heather for luck, eh? Yes, yes!
Must have one of those little sprigs in my button-hole—memento
of a very happy occasion!—Bless
my soul, everybody finished except me?
I talk too much, ha-ha!—must get on.”</p>

<p>He went on eating very quickly, talking
between mouthfuls.</p>

<p>“‘Mock-orange,’ eh? Capital! Hope it
won’t be long before we all see <em>real</em> orange-blossom,
a wreath of it, round the pretty head of
a certain young lady in white! Yes! dash it
all, Mary, I must drink that in champagne.”</p>

<p>He took champagne.</p>

<p>So did I. I felt I was going to need it!</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters let it foam and sizzle into her
glass; Blanche, though murmuring that the
horrid stuff always reminded her of seltzer-water
that the knives had been washed in, sipped at it
for the sake of the “occasion.” Major Montresor
took it—reverting afterwards to his
invariable whisky and soda.</p>

<p>The only “grown-up” who didn’t take it was
my employer. Still Waters refused his usual
peg and drank plain water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>Every now and then he seemed to be making
spasmodic efforts to remember that he had
guests under his roof; but they weren’t successful!
This added to my discomfort! I saw his
mother glance at him, but only once, and with
a half-humorous little smile! Didn’t she <em>mind</em>
the fact of the host remaining well over the
verge of unmitigated sulks? Apparently not!
Possibly she’s seen him in his tantrums before
now—even though she didn’t know the reason
of these! I was feeling almost thankful that
one of the guests was such a host in himself;
thankful, up to a point, for Theo’s gusto! For
the child who was “sitting-up” grew more
excited as each course was handed round. With
her rose-flushed cheeks, her tossed curls from
which the white fillet had slipped crookedly
down over one eyebrow, her roving brown
gaze, and her giggling spirits that raced higher
and higher with the bubbles in the glasses
(of the others), she was the model of an infant
Bacchante. “Sitting-up!” It was her
wretched brother whom she was causing to sit
up, and his still more wretched official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>!
The only thing to do was for both of us to rise
to the situation. Only he wouldn’t—or couldn’t.
So, once more <em>I</em> had to.</p>

<p>There is after all a certain relief in feeling
you’ve reached the climax of all things, and that
Fate <em>cannot</em> have anything worse in store!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>And this I <em>did</em> feel when Uncle Albert,
having tossed off his toast, expressed a wish to
know what sort of place the young folks fancied
for their honeymoon.</p>

<p>“Oh, the Riviera!” was what I rushed into
the breach with here. “It would be so glorious
to see palms and flowering oleanders, and casinos,
and scent all growing wild!—I mean the Parma
violets for it—against a brilliant blue sea—such
a treat to see a really bright blue bay and golden
sunshine in the middle of winter——”</p>

<p>“Winter?” put in Uncle Albert quite indignantly.
“But my dear, we’re well on into
June now; you aren’t going to keep this poor
Billy of yours”—with a wave of the hand
towards the head of the table—“waiting for
his wedding till November or December,
<em>surely</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh—er—why not?—we thought so.”</p>

<p>“We thought—that is, Miss—er—<em>she</em> said,”
blurted out the Governor desperately, “that
a year’s engagement was——”</p>

<p>“Far too long, my boy!” interrupted his
uncle peremptorily, “far too long! Don’t you
give in to her about that! Why wait, Billy?
What the dickens is there to wait <em>for</em>? (What’s
this—ice? No, thanks.) Why, when I was
a fine young fellow of your age, if I’d got a bonnie
girl like that to look kindly at me, and enough
money to keep her in style, I’d not have rested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
until I’d clapped a plain gold ring on the top of
those diamonds on her finger. Nothing like
settling down happily as soon as you’ve got the
chance. Like that picture—what is it—oh, you
know! Finest picture that ever was painted,
I consider—in the Royal Academy years ago—prints
of it in every shop-window—what’s the
name of the thing?”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>My friend Mr. White</cite>’?” suggested the
Major.</p>

<p>“No, no; <em>what</em> the dickens is it? A really
beautiful thing, now, if I could only remember——”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Hope</cite>,’ by G. F. Watts?” put in the
Governor’s mother softly.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Harmony</cite>’?” suggested Blanche.</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Simple Aveu</cite>’—no—‘<cite>The Soul’s Awakening</cite>,’
Uncle Albert?” fortissimo from Theo.</p>

<p>“No—none o’ those. You all know it,
though. I shall think of the name in a minute.
Anyhow, I shall give these two young people
the best print to be got of it, to hang up in their
hall.”</p>

<p>And his prominent grey eyes seemed to be
staring over my head at some imaginary plan of
this entrance!</p>

<p>“Only, they must hurry up, mind! No more
of this nonsense about their waiting a twelve-month
and courting all the love away! Happy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the wooing that’s not long a-doing: isn’t that
right, Major?”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite!” Major Montresor got his
word in edge-ways at last. “To my sorrow”
(old humbug!) “be it spoken! You see,
Waters, the longer you play your fish, the more
likely he—that is, <em>she</em>—is to get away! You’ve
got to put on all the strain your tackle will bear
at <em>once</em>!”</p>

<p>“Hear that, Bill?” (The Governor was
looking as if <em>he</em> would not be able to stand much
more strain of this kind.) “Put it all on at
once—excellent advice! And where are you
going to have the wedding, Mary? Here, I
daresay?”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> had hoped so,” said Mrs. Waters, with her
pretty smile at me.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; <em>here</em>, Uncle Albert!” cried
Blanche, who, I know, would regard this wedding
as a dress-rehearsal of her own. And then she
and Theo began to enlarge, in a kind of two-part
pæon, on this function that will never be.</p>

<p>“A big tent on the lawn——”</p>

<p>“Red carpet across the gravel——”</p>

<p>“A <em>huge</em> wedding-cake just in that very
place”—with a bacchanalian gesture towards
the mirrored table-centre. “All the lovely
presents put out in the den——”</p>

<p>“Too small, Blanche! I know Uncle Albert
will want to give them <em>all</em> his furniture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“In mother’s bedroom, then! We could
easily get it to look like not that at all!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Billy and Nancy standing up in
the drawing-room together for all the people
to look at and shake hands with, and kiss——”</p>

<p>(Here a sound as of the word “Pup-chick!”
from the other parlourmaid, who was disposing
the finger-glasses.)</p>

<p>“Yes, and showers of confetti dropping out
of everybody’s hat for weeks afterwards——”</p>

<p>“And the band playing like anything all the
time—<em>all</em> the wedding-marches and glides and
rag time and all the waltzes that make you feel
you <em>must</em> dance——”</p>

<p>“And a white satin slipper tied on to the back
of the motor when they go away——”</p>

<p>“Yes! One of mine, so’s you can see it!
Oh, won’t it be a gorgeous day!” trumpeted
Theo, bounding up and down as if wire springs
only held her to her chair. “Oh, <em>why</em> isn’t it
going to be next week? Still, even this evening
is <em>almost</em> as good as a sort of wedding-breakfast!
Don’t you think so, everybody? With Nancy
looking so sweet in that dress, and the way I’ve
done the table, and the champagne, and everything?
Only, in one way”—crescendo—“it’s
<em>better</em>! Because, if it were the <em>real</em> wedding,
the bride and bridegroom would be leaving us
to-night! And as it is, they’re staying on,”
concluded Theodora, with a peal of rapturous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
laughter, “and there’ll be <em>no</em> horrid good-byes
to say, and <em>no</em> crying!”</p>

<p>“<em>Won’t</em> there!” came from the straight lips
of her brother, in a grimmer and more deadly
tone than even I had ever heard. “<em>You’ll</em> be
crying, miss, before the evening’s over.”</p>

<p>And, to anticipate a little, she <em>was</em>.</p>

<p>In half an hour or so, the easily-wounded heart
of thirteen was being sobbed out on her pillow.
For when, after the gratifications of a “quite
grown-up bow” from Major Montresor and a
prophecy from Uncle Albert that it wouldn’t
be many years now before Theo had a wedding-breakfast-table
of her own to decorate, the
child had turned a glowing face up to her
brother’s, she had received only the curtest of
“good nights” dropped over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="tb">To me the thought of that farewell glimpse
of him was nothing less than a reprieve.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness that, as he’s got two men-guests
to attend to, it’ll be the last of him that
I shall be obliged to put up with this evening!”
thought I, as I rose to follow Mrs. Waters. “He’ll
have to disappear into the den or the billiard-room
with <em>them</em>. <em>I</em> shall have an evening off.
Yes! a regular ‘evening off,’ like the maids!
Only, I suppose, a housemaid uses those evenings
to <em>see</em> her young man. With me, it’s just the
other way round. ‘No followers allowed’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
indeed! ‘Nothing BUT following’ has been my
trouble. So hurray for a nice peaceful evening
in the drawing-room with his mother and Blanche.
After that <em>ghastly</em> meal, how I shall enjoy the
rest!”</p>

<p>Even as I was congratulating myself upon it,
my hopes were again dashed to the ground—this
time, of course, by the hand of Uncle Albert.</p>

<p>“No, no, Billy. The Major and I are too old
not to let you have your bit of time to yourselves
now, aren’t we, Montresor?”</p>

<p>“<em>Rather!</em>” with hollow geniality from the
Major.</p>

<p>Apparently it’s one thing for a man to mention
his “declining years” and add about fifteen of
them to his age. It’s quite another to find
himself claimed as a contemporary by a man
who’s ten years older than he is!</p>

<p>“We two old fogies can look after ourselves,
my boy. We’re not going to keep you in here,
away from your girl. Not a word!—that’s quite
all right—quite understood! Been young ourselves
once, though you may not believe it—off
with you!”</p>

<p>And, to my unspeakable fury, he closed the
dining-room door upon what he’s pleased to
call “these young people.” The door of the
drawing-room had already been shut upon Mrs.
Waters and Blanche!</p>

<p>Was there to be <em>no</em> respite, then, after the awful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
meal I had just sat through? A nice evening
it had been—this dinner which I suppose had
been meant to be so jolly for all of us, as well
as for the two guests! Well! at the end of it
all here was Major Montresor piqued; Theo in
tears; the parlour-maids glared at, and Cariad
kicked! Even Uncle Albert hadn’t been able
to remember the name of the horrible picture,
whatever it was, that he meant to give “us.”</p>

<p>And now here was I, left stranded once more
face to face with my fuming employer; only,
this time, with the memory of that child’s light-hearted
mockery of stage-management between
us!</p>

</div>

<p>“Well! I suppose there is nothing for
it but to go in here,” I said, marching,
with my head well up, to the door of the
den.</p>

<p>The Governor was only just in time to open
it for me. Without a look at him I walked in,
making straight for the piano-stool.</p>

<p>I sat down. I planted my foot firmly upon
the loud pedal. My fingers clutched at the first
chords of a spirited war-song as if it were a life-buoy.</p>

<p>“Do sing!” I heard myself fling almost imperiously
at my employer.</p>

<p>He sang—not well.</p>

<p>“And please keep on singing,” I said, into the
last chords of the song. “<em>Loud</em> ones, please.”</p>

<p>Without any further conversation, we went
doggedly through “<cite>Drake’s Drum</cite>” and “<cite>The
Two Grenadiers</cite>.”</p>

<p>I simply wasn’t going to let Uncle Albert
Waters, left in the dining-room with Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Montresor, imagine that his nephew and I had
gone into the den to—to make anything but—music
for one single instant that evening. Let
them hear for themselves that we were busy at
the piano the whole time!</p>

<p>They could hear well enough through the
wall of the dining-room——</p>

<p>No! Apparently they couldn’t hear well
enough. For no sooner had we come to the
end of those bars of the “<cite>Marseillaise</cite>” that conclude
the Grenadier song, than the door of the
den was thrown open and in walked those two
other men.</p>

<p>Uncle Albert, of course in advance, pranced
up to the piano, thumped his fist into the open
palm of the other hand, leaned over the piano
towards us, then, in a solemn, confidential,
impressive tone of voice, he brought out—one
word. It was the word:</p>

<p>“<em>Wedded!</em>”</p>

<p>“What?” rapped out the Governor, sharply
wheeling round. And I couldn’t help gasping,
wondering if this old gentleman had suddenly
come under some hallucination about our being
more, even, than merely “engaged.”</p>

<p>“Yes. ‘Wedded,’” repeated Uncle Albert,
raising his voice again to its normal blare. “You
know!—The fellow and the girl! That first-rate
picture by Millais or Holman Hunt or
one of ’em. Anyhow, you know it. She’s got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
her head resting right back against the young
chap’s shoulder, like this”—</p>

<p>(Unsuccessful imitation of the pose of Leighton’s
model by Uncle Albert against the piano.)</p>

<p>—“And he’s lifting her hand to his mouth—<em>you</em>
know. That’s the one. That’s the name I
was puzzling over half through dinner, and it
only just dawned upon me just as I finished my
cigar. I had to come in and tell you. And, if
we’re not <i lang="fr">de trop</i>,” added that appalling old
man, settling down like a big collapsible toy
in one of the huge arm-chairs, “we’d like to
hear just one tune in here. ‘If he’s only <em>singing</em>,’
as I said to the Major, ‘he might just as well
have company by as not, and I’m fond of a good
song after dinner!’ So now, Billy, what have
you got there? D’you know that A 1 thing—ah,
what is it? What a man I am for forgetting
names! Something bandy—not Bandy-legs——”</p>

<p>“Ha!” Major Montresor, from the other
big chair, came to the rescue. “‘<cite>The Bando-lero</cite>’!”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Know it, William? ‘I <em>am</em>
the Bando-lero!’” vociferated Uncle Albert,
“‘the—something—Bando-lero——’”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said my employer, with restraint,
“but I haven’t got it in the house!”</p>

<p>It was my turn to suppress a smile as I remembered
how, in my nursery-days, I’d defined
“<i>a bandolero</i>” as “<i>a person with a very loud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
voice</i>,” just as naturally as I used to think that
“<i>a Radical</i>” meant “<i>a dreadfully wicked
man</i>.” It was the very song that I could imagine
Uncle Albert enjoying singing himself. A pity
his nephew didn’t happen to have it in the
house!</p>

<p>“You have this, though,” I suggested helpfully,
as I turned to the rack and took out “<cite>The
Storm-Fiend</cite>,” with a look at the Governor
meaning, “Don’t dare to say you loathe this
thing!” (It was because he did, by the way,
that the song had been ordered for him in a burst
of unsisterliness by Theo.)</p>

<p>“Yes! <em>You</em> can look soft nothings at the
girl, my boy!” was Uncle Albert’s interpretation
of that glance of the Governor’s as I spoke,
“but she’s got to keep those pretty dark eyes of
hers for the music!”</p>

<p>(—And I wonder the sheet of music didn’t
shrivel up under the gaze of the eyes thus
praised!)</p>

<p>We then proceeded to dash through “<cite>The
Storm-Fiend</cite>.” I wondered whether the
Governor found in the loud singing of it as
much of a safety-valve as I found in the playing
of the artillery-like accompaniment!</p>

<p>“Bravo! Very good! Stirring song, that!”
Uncle Albert’s bellow swelled the echoes of the
last chord. “Capital song—very well sung.
I like that tune—‘<i>I chuckle and laugh, ho, ho!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
I chuckle and laugh, ho, ho!</i>’” he persisted (to
some tune quite of his own). “‘<cite>The Storm-Fiend
is the Lord—of—Woe!</cite>’ Very good! Still,
not very appropriate for to-night, Billy? Not
much Woe about this evening, my dear, eh?”
(to me). “Supposing we have a bit of sentiment
now. What was that other song, now? I was
talking about it only at tea-time here—something
tally-ho-ish that we could all join in the chorus
of.”</p>

<p>But here I felt I simply must nip in the
bud a request for the one about—</p>

<p>“<i>All my Fancy dwells upon Nancy.</i>”</p>

<p>“Nancy” had had <em>enough</em>!</p>

<p>So I rose, saying gently, “If you will excuse
me, I am rather tired”—</p>

<p>This was no fib!</p>

<p>—“and I think I will go to bed early. Good
night, Mr. Waters,” politely to that awful
Uncle Albert. “Good-bye, Major Montresor;
so nice to have seen you again like this....
Good-night,” with a little nod to my official
<i lang="fr">fiancé</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Be the day weary, be the day long</i>....’”
I thought. But we hadn’t <em>even yet</em> come to the
end of it.</p>

<p>For Uncle Albert Waters had bounded up
again from the deep chair like a large india-rubber
ball, with yet another protest to his
nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that? what’s that? Ah, but that’ll
never do. Never!” reverberated through
the den. “You’re never going to let the girl
go off like that, Billy?—Just a word and a nod?”</p>

<p>Good heavens—what could he mean?</p>

<p>“Why! She’d never think anything of you
again, lad! Never mind two old has-beens like
us. We don’t count, do we, Major? Don’t
you take any notice of us. You kiss your sweetheart
good night, like a sensible youngster!”
And before I could escape, before either of us
had fully realized what this terrible, bellowing,
stout, red-faced, eyes-on-stalked, cigar-scented,
coarse, <em>horrid</em> old man would take it into his
head to say or do next, he had literally pushed
us into each other’s arms.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether it was for a minute or
for half a second that I was given over to feeling
the true horror of this position; to wondering
what on earth my make-believe <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> meant me
to do about it—what <em>he</em> meant to do.</p>

<p>Then he—the Governor—decided the matter
for me.</p>

<p>With the suddenest of movements he ducked
swiftly forward and bent, without further look
or word, to kiss me. I was too petrified to
draw back even the fraction of an inch from the
touch of his lips; it brushed by, scarcely stirring
on my cheek, to fall almost roughly on the ripple
of dark hair above my ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>Then he bolted to the door and held it open
for my headlong exit from the den.</p>

<p>To the sound of an explosive “<em>That’s</em> more
like it!” from Uncle Waters. “You surely
never——” (Slam! from the door) I tore across
the hall. I didn’t pause for any more good
nights in the drawing-room. I rushed upstairs
to my bedroom.</p>

<p>Here I flung myself down into one of the rosy-chintz
chairs by the open window and gasped
while I tried to collect my whirling wits.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>What <em>had</em> happened? What was he—that
young man—doing to <em>allow</em> anything to happen?
His “official” <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>? Was this what he
meant by “official”—it wasn’t what <em>I</em> meant,
and I would let him know that. I was furious
with him—His uncle’s fault?—Yes! But he
ought to have managed so that <em>That</em> wasn’t
thrust upon me like this.</p>

<p>I <em>was</em> angry!</p>

<p>Then I couldn’t help laughing a little at the
mad incongruity of it.</p>

<p>Kissed, by Still Waters!</p>

<p>What could he think I thought of it? What
was <em>he</em> thinking about it all now, downstairs
there with those other two horrible men?
What was his Uncle Albert thinking? Chuckling
and laughing, ho, ho! I expected....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>That ghastly moment!</p>

<p>That ghastly, <em>ghastly</em> moment!...</p>

<p>Thank goodness that the Governor did at
least end it as soon as was humanly possible.
And, after all, that quick gesture of his hardly
counts as a kiss. I’ve seen the love-scenes in
private theatricals carried out just like that by
bashful amateurs. A stage-kiss; a sham one;
in fact, no kiss at all.</p>

<p>Well, that, anyhow, was decent of Still
Waters....</p>

<p>But <em>was</em> it? Was he thinking of <em>my</em> feelings?
I don’t believe he was.</p>

<p>I believe—at least, a month ago I might have
believed—with the rest of the girls at the office,
that that would be his only conception of kissing
a girl. I can’t believe that now—not of a
brother of Theo’s and Blanche’s—not of a son of
Mrs. Waters’s! His father, Blanche said, was
so devoted to her ... their boy would have
inherited some sort of idea of the real thing!
Besides, a young man who’s already surprised me
by being able to sing like that, and to be keen
on dancing, and to win swimming competitions,
and to look, sometimes, quite <em>human</em>! Oh, no!</p>

<p>It was <em>meant</em> for being decent.</p>

<p>He’d scarcely touched me—except just on the
hair.</p>

<p>Then I felt furious again.</p>

<p>My hair—my pet vanity—the prettiest thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
about me! Once Sydney Vandeleur begged
me for a piece of it to keep—that piece with the
ripple—as if I’d cut it! If I had, it wouldn’t
have got kissed....</p>

<p>Hateful, clumsy, blundering, or <em>something</em>
young man! He <em>needn’t</em> have kissed me at all!
He <em>could</em> have got out of it—in spite of his
detestable old uncle.</p>

<p>Couldn’t he have seemed to think that I was
too shy to let him in public, and allowed me to
slip away? Or couldn’t he have followed me
into the hall and shut the door and <em>pretended</em>?</p>

<p>Or couldn’t he have hatched up some joke on
the spur of the moment and announced
cheerfully—</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t say our good nights in here,
Uncle; outside in the veranda is where we say
good night”—or something like that?</p>

<p>Easily.</p>

<p>Then what did he mean by it?</p>

<p>Was it that this excruciating evening, with
its countless trials, had worn his patience absolutely
through, and that he felt he must vent
his fury on something besides Cariad? Was
that kiss a kind of “let-fly” at <em>me</em>?</p>

<p>How frightfully unfair! As if I’d done anything
but rush into breaches and make the best
of things for him! Good gracious! I shall
tell him exactly what I think of it all to-morrow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>But the evening held one last trial for me
before I was able to slip into that springy snowdrift
of a bed and lie tossing, indignantly
awake, for quite an hour after I’d heard the
motor puff off, taking Major Montresor to
catch his last train up to town.</p>

<p>This trial was heralded by a tap at my door.</p>

<p>Enter Blanche in her <i lang="fr">débutante’s</i> dinner-gown.</p>

<p>“How early you’re going to bed, Nancy!
We thought you were still with Billy, but Uncle
Albert’s taken him on at billiards—he says he’s
playing worse than anyone he’s ever seen. Is
anything the matter, dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—nothing; why?”</p>

<p>“You look so flushed—I thought you might
have a headache.”</p>

<p>A headache—ah! valuable antique feminine
excuse for everything! “Yes—perhaps I have,
a little.”</p>

<p>“Poor darling! Everybody <em>did</em> seem to be
talking at once at dinner, and Uncle Albert <em>is</em>
such a fog-horn, enough to go through anybody’s
head. Let me brush your hair for you, will
you?”</p>

<p>I had to let her.</p>

<p>“It’ll be better with all these pins and clips
out,” said Blanche, unfastening and shaking
loose. “Goodness, what lots you’ve got! It’s
like yards and yards of black skein-silk. And
<em>how</em> lovely and soft.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>And here, in the looking-glass, I saw the girl’s
face, blonde and clear-featured as her brother’s,
pressed for a moment to the ripple of dark hair
above my ear.</p>

<p>It must have looked something like that just
now to those two other men in the den....</p>

<p>Then I saw my own face turn scarlet.</p>

<p>Blanche Waters saw that too.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry,” she murmured, with a little
“understanding” smile. “Mustn’t I?”</p>

<p>She might just as well have <em>said</em>, “Mustn’t
anybody except Billy kiss you just there?”</p>

<p>—Which did, as my brother Jack would say,
put the lid on it!</p>

<p>Well! to-morrow I am going to put my foot
down, very firmly, on anything more of <em>this</em>
sort!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST HANDSHAKE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>This morning I was just finishing dressing
when I heard a blackbird’s whistle, two
or three times repeated, just outside my window.</p>

<p>It interrupted my meditations on a rather
interesting subject.</p>

<p>Namely: What was my employer going to
say to me to-day about that episode last night?</p>

<p>How—in what spirit, in what words, would
he make his apology?</p>

<p>Of course I know that for the offence of having
kissed a girl who is nothing to him there <em>is</em> no
apology a man can make. The mere suggestion
of apologizing for that is adding insult to injury.
The only possible excuse is to say: “<i>I don’t
expect you to forgive me, but I couldn’t help myself</i>”—allowing
an unspoken—“<i>and I’d do it
again if I had the chance</i>” to be interpreted by
the tone in which it was spoken.</p>

<p>However, <em>that</em> was quite out of the question
here, seeing that there had been no kiss of
that sort in the affair. The offence, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
was just as inexcusable; more so. To have kissed
me on the hair—why, even as I took up my
brushes before the glass this morning I saw the
reflection of another angry wave of scarlet in
my face brought there by the memory which
can’t be just brushed away.</p>

<p>It might not have been so infuriating if it
hadn’t been the first time....</p>

<p>For I’d never before allowed any man to attempt
such a thing. I’ve always known that one
ought to stick to what Lady Mary Wortley-Montague
says in that little poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He <em>comes too near</em> who <em>comes to be denied</em>!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I remembered that last night, as I lay
awake; remembered quoting it to Cicely Harradine.
She had laughed and turned rather pink—this
was after some dance we’d both been to at
the Slade—and had said, “Yes, Tots dear;
that is so sweet—and so awfully true, of course;
only—it <em>was</em> in the eighteenth century, dear,
wasn’t it? and isn’t it <em>rather</em> what you call ‘a
Counsel of Perfection?’”</p>

<p>It oughtn’t to be so—it needn’t have been so
for me, but now—that’s all been spoilt—and
by <em>him</em>!</p>

<p>What can he say about it?</p>

<p>“Nothing else for it—my uncle’s doing.”—Yes,
but I’ve got all my answers for <em>that</em> excuse.</p>

<p>“I was goaded into it by having had such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
awful evening; felt I must do something outrageous.”
Yes, but not <em>that</em>! I had had an
awful evening too! And <em>I</em> hadn’t wanted to
kiss anybody!</p>

<p>“Hadn’t time to think of anything else.”</p>

<p>Nonsense! A business man with his wits
sharpened by daily interviews with other sharp-witted
people for whose benefit he has to think
out, even while he’s speaking, excuses, schemes,
promises, goodness knows what! Oh, he’d have
to say something more convincing than that to me!</p>

<p>Again I heard the whistle—a monotonous
note for a blackbird’s! Then came a sharp tap
at my opened, latticed, wistaria-garlanded casement.
A pebble had been flung up against it.</p>

<p>This gave me quite a little jump; it brought
back old days at home; when Sydney, staying
in the house, had wanted to bring me out for a
stroll before breakfast.</p>

<p>“Must be Theo,” I said aloud to myself.
But something told me it wasn’t. I looked out.
Yes. There on the gravel beneath, in a blue
serge suit that seemed to make his sleek head shine
quite golden in the morning sunshine, stood my
employer, looking up.</p>

<p>Waiting for me to come out? Throwing
stones up to catch my attention? Who taught
him that?</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said quietly. “Will
you come down when you are ready?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>I nodded as ungraciously as I could, and drew
back at once. I was quite ready, but I stopped
dead-still by the wardrobe glass for a long moment,
letting him wait. Then I turned to the door.</p>

<p>Then I came back again.</p>

<p>I took the shadiest hat I’ve got out of its drawer
and pulled it down firmly over my hair, stabbing
it on with my swastika hatpin, my hand-wrought
silver one that Sydney designed for me, my two
mounted regimental buttons of father’s, and my
little pearl-headed one. I daresay my head did
look all bristling with spikes, like the Statue of
Liberty’s. But if I’d had more pins I’d have
stuck them <em>all</em> in! And even if I do, like Blanche
and Theo, usually go about hatless in the gardens,
I was going to use all the “cover” I could to
meet the Governor’s apology, whatever it might
be. For <em>now</em> he was going to have his work
cut out for him! And whatever he began to say
about last night’s brusque, snatched kiss, I
wasn’t going to help him out by one syllable.
I could wait. Let him explain; floundering
about for words, probably, as he hasn’t floundered
yet! Feeling most satisfactorily composed
myself, I came down the stairs. One of the
maids, in china-blue print, moved aside a dust-pan
for me to pass.</p>

<p>Then I saw something that ruffled me again.</p>

<p>In that dust-pan there was a handful of pink,
crystallized rose-leaves and a couple of tiny silver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
horseshoes—Theodora’s “confetti!” It must
have dropped out of the draping of my skirt as
I rushed upstairs—was there no getting away
from last night?—and I know that there was
something more than well-trained civility in that
girl’s smiling “Good morning, Miss Nancy!”</p>

<p>Why can’t they say “Miss Trant”? Do they
consider it isn’t worth while for so short a time,
as they think?—<em>Hateful</em> household!</p>

<p>I had only just unruffled myself again as I
faced the Governor in the sunshine outside.</p>

<p>“Come in here, won’t you?” he said, holding
open the little white gate under the rambler
arch of the rose-garden.</p>

<p>It was just then a bouquet of warm, scented
colour, shading down from the deepest damask
of the bed of Jeune Amours, through the rosy,
straggling Baroness von Ulks and the faintly-flushed
Cuisses des Nymphes to the dead-white
Frau Karl Druschkis—such a rose-garden, such
an earthly paradise for a before-breakfast stroll—<em>alone</em>!</p>

<p>Side by side we paced slowly down to the end
of the box-bordered path between the pink
Maman Cochets (another echo of last night!)
before another word was said.</p>

<p>Then he began. “I wanted to have this opportunity
of saying something to you.”</p>

<p>His tone was conciliatory, quiet. The expression
of his face was—well, not in the least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
his mask of office-hours, nor the scowling barricade
he put up at last night’s dinner-table; but
guarded and absolutely non-committal.</p>

<p>So was mine, I hope.</p>

<p>I waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>“I may tell you,” he went on, “that I’ve been
regretting—”</p>

<p>Last night, I supposed? A curious way of
<em>putting</em> it!</p>

<p>—“regretting for some time that it was you
I asked to take on this—this situation for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>We turned and walked back again.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he added quietly, “that I regret
having dragged a girl of your kind, more sensitive
and spirited than I had imagined—”</p>

<p>What <em>had</em> he imagined, then?</p>

<p>—“into this affair.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose I ought to have known better
than to ask—<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, for the third time, and I meant
to stop there. But somehow I couldn’t help
going on rather acidly, “And which of your
other employees do you wish you had asked
instead? Miss Robinson?”</p>

<p>(Who would have been provided with material
for impersonations of the family Waters for the
rest of her life.)</p>

<p>—“Or Miss Holt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>(<em>She</em>, I know, would have screamed aloud when
he inflicted that extraordinary kiss upon her!)</p>

<p>“Miss Smith, of course, has her affections
otherwise engaged——”</p>

<p>“Ah? And so that would have been a barrier,
would it? Even to this kind of an affair?”
retorted the Governor, very quickly and looking
hard at me.</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. He was thinking of
the Major’s clumsy bringing-up, yesterday, of
the name of Sydney Vandeleur.</p>

<p>So I lifted my eyes, which had been idly studying
the grey pattern of shadow flung by a trellised
rose-arch upon my creamy skirt, and I
looked the Governor firmly in the face as I said
quietly:</p>

<p>“I imagine so.”</p>

<p>Then <em>he</em> said, “Oh.”</p>

<p>And then there was another pause.</p>

<p>Surely Mr. Waters could not break it by anything
else, now, than by coming to the point—saying
whatever it was he meant to say about his
behaviour at the door of the den? But nothing
of the kind.</p>

<p>“You quite understand, then, that I am sorry—for
bringing you into all this?” he began
again. “Right. Now, I suppose I ought to
offer to release you from the arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” I looked up again quickly,
hopefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“Only, you see, I can’t,” my employer concluded,
slowly. “I can’t do that. The—er—my—the
reason which forced me into it is—still
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>Another turn. This time towards the pergola.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” he went on—and this time
I really did think I knew what was coming next.
“About last night.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say, “Oh”—I simply waited for
whatever apology he thought fit to make.</p>

<p>“Last night, in the drawing-room before
dinner. I’m afraid I was rather rude.”</p>

<p>“<em>Before</em> dinner?” I echoed, forgetting what
could have happened then.</p>

<p>“Yes; when you were asking me about that
place in Wales, Porth Cariad,” he said. “I
told you, rather off-handedly, I’m afraid, that
there was ‘a wooden woman’ there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, there is. It’s the figure-head of a
ship, some vessel that was wrecked in the
bay, years ago,” explained the Governor quite
simply. “They’ve put it up beyond the two
cottages there, on the cliff. I ought to have
explained that at the time.”</p>

<p>Well! And wasn’t there anything else he had
to explain? With all these “Oh’s” and pauses,
he was a long, long time in coming to that
unjustifiable kiss—and yet something convinced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
me that his mind was full of it even while he
mentioned these other things first.</p>

<p>“Besides that,” he went on deliberately,
“there’s something I was thinking over last
night, for quite a time before I went to sleep.”</p>

<p>Ah! At last!</p>

<p>“I wanted to suggest——” he was saying,
when, from behind the leafy screen of the pergola
there came a booming cry of:</p>

<p>“Aha! Here they are! here they are!
Might have known what they were at! Love
among the roses, eh?”</p>

<p>And in another moment there hove into view
the rotund, white-waistcoated form and the
rosy John Bull face, smiling under the light
grey, dented felt hat, of Uncle Albert Waters.</p>

<p>Beaming and rubbing his hands, he advanced
upon us.</p>

<p>“Now, young people, young people! Breakfast’s
ready! Didn’t hear the gong, eh? No,
of course not. Something better to listen to,
as I said. <em>I</em> heard you, Billy! I heard you
whistling under her window half an hour ago!
Something worth while being an early bird for
now, what? But come along.”</p>

<p>He slipped one arm into his nephew’s, the
other into mine, and wheeled us round towards
the house.</p>

<p>“I told your mother I’d come out myself
and fetch you in!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>Perfectly unconscious that if wishes could have
killed he must have fallen down shrivelled to a
cinder on the garden path, he rolled on happily
between us towards the French windows of the
dining-room, prattling robustiously all the way.</p>

<p>“Nothing comes up to that nine-o’clock-in-the-morning
smell of bacon and coffee, does it?
Smells far better than it tastes, they say! Which
reminds me that I once heard a young lady,
Nancy, my dear—only she was a cynical young
person, not nearly so pretty—I heard her say
that the best part of frizzling bacon was like
Love—all in the anticipation! Never tasted
as good as it promised to, so to speak! Of
course you don’t agree with her?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, <em>no</em>!” I cried hastily, partly because
I felt I must disagree with somebody, partly
because I realized that the inevitable effect of
this detestable old man upon his nephew was to
strike him dumb when he ought to have spoken!</p>

<p>“Ah, quite right, quite right!” responded
Uncle Albert, with an affectionate pressure of
my arm in his. “<em>That’s</em> the attitude! I don’t
believe in this modern plan of analysing
everything down to nothing, do you?”</p>

<p>“<em>Hate</em> it,” I said viciously—meaning that I
hated having my arm squeezed by horrible
relations-in-law never-to-be.</p>

<p>“I see you do! Good! My dear, I’m delighted
to find that Billy’s sweetheart sees eye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
to eye with Billy’s uncle on so many points.
That’s why I’m taking you out this morning—Oh,
yes! you too, my boy! Not going to
separate the turtle-doves!—going to take you
both out if you can beg mother off from church.
I’m going to motor you over—not a hundred
miles away, and show you something—Aha!
Something that I fancy you will approve of as
much as I do!”</p>

<p>“Heavens! What will this new horror turn
out to be?” thought I; catching the same
question in the Governor’s eye as we entered the
dining-room, where the family, including Cariad,
was already at breakfast, and sat down to the
coffee and bacon of old Mr. Waters’ disgusting
metaphor. We weren’t long spared the answer
to that question.</p>

<p>“Now, Mary! I’ve just been telling our
two young people here,” began Uncle Albert
almost at once, “that they’re going over in the
car with me this fine morning to look at something
I particularly want them to see. Now, I’ll give
you three guesses what it is—No, I won’t—”</p>

<p>(Interrupting Theo, who had leapt up in her
chair with a shriek of “Wedding presents!
That picture!”)</p>

<p>“—I want the pleasure of telling you myself.
Picture? No, child. Something to put the
picture in—to <em>be</em> the picture in, ho, ho! It’s
a house to let!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“A <em>house</em>!” murmured Blanche, clasping
her hands, and obviously seeing herself helping
to arrange the flowers in it.</p>

<p>“A charming house, only fifteen miles from
here. Just the place for Billy and his Nancy
to settle down in when they get married,” enlarged
the elderly <i lang="fr">enfant terrible</i>. “In fact,
once they’ve seen it, they’ll want to motor on
and order that special licence at once, I shouldn’t
wonder!”</p>

<p>Mercy! I turned my eyes to Mrs. Waters, as
if imploring her help to change the conversation;
she only nodded and smiled and murmured:
“Pretty blouse—I always like you in lacy
white things, Nancy!”</p>

<p>There was no checking Uncle Albert; on he
went:</p>

<p>“I was looking at the place only last week,
and it’s still going! There’s a rose-garden, my
dear, almost as prettily arranged as the one here
that you were billing and cooing in just now.
And a splendid vegetable garden for the more
practical side of life. South aspect!—Very excellent
fish-curry, Mary—Nice, airy bedrooms!
<em>And</em>”—his voice took on an impressive rallentando—“Now,
what do you think? A
little—a little white wicket-gate at the top
of the stairs! That’s the crowning touch,
eh?”</p>

<p>Yes. It was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“That was what took <em>my</em> fancy, you know!
I immediately said to myself——”</p>

<p>At all costs, I felt, must Uncle Albert be kept
from repeating what he had said to himself.</p>

<p>“Yes—But, Mr. Waters,” I interrupted
wildly, “I’m so afraid that that house wouldn’t—couldn’t
do for <em>us</em>!”</p>

<p>“What, my dear! Why not? If you only
see it, you’ll say as I did——”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s perfectly lovely,” I burst in;
“but the fact of the matter is that we—we have
arranged to live in London”—“and in separate
houses for ever,” I might have added. I went on
improvising rapidly. “You see, we shall have a
town house for most of the year, and for the
summer we’re looking round for a sort of—of
farmhouse, with two cottages by the sea, you
know! In—in Anglesey, I think. I am so
fond of—of that part of the country, so—Those
were our plans, aren’t they?” I concluded,
with one reckless “Say so, <em>do</em>!” glance
at the Governor.</p>

<p>“Yes—rather! That’s what <em>we’d</em> thought of!”
he returned, with a glance back at me which
betrayed something very like pure gratitude.</p>

<p>As well it might!</p>

<p>For again, just before I spoke, my employer
had been at such an utter loss that—for the first
time since I’d seen him, I felt positively <em>sorry</em>
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>And I answered his glance with the tiniest
nod of encouragement.</p>

<p>They were the first friendly signals that had
ever passed between us.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Look here. I must speak to you.”</p>

<p>This was my employer, hurriedly to me after
breakfast, in the veranda. Now, as that deep,
shady veranda is built all the way round the house,
as every one of the windows gives on to it, and
as all the windows are always wide open, I couldn’t
help giving a look round it as much as to say,
“Here?”</p>

<p>“Not here,” he muttered, still more hurriedly.
“This seems to be the deuce of a house to talk
in—never saw such a place. And there’s no
time now. My uncle was going to take us along
in the car——”</p>

<p>“<em>Must</em> we go?” I asked, softly and ruefully,
with my back to one of the pillars.</p>

<p>“No. I’ve knocked that on the head—I’m
going to take him off by myself to play golf.
I said you’d really rather go to church with my
mother and the girls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks so much,” I said fervently.
“I certainly would!”</p>

<p>“So I thought. Well, then, we shall be
lunching at the Club House—or, anyhow, getting
lunch somewhere out—not coming back here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>I nearly said, “Thanks, so much!” once more.</p>

<p>I also nearly smiled to think that anyone else,
catching sight of the two of us talking so quickly,
so quietly, and so close together under the soft
mauve fringe of wistaria-blossom that drooped
from the glazed roof, might easily have imagined
that our conspiracy was how to spend most of
this glorious Sunday <em>together</em>, instead of <em>apart</em>!</p>

<p>“We might not even be back for tea,” said the
Governor.</p>

<p>“And when is——” I paused and turned
my eyes towards the house, “<em>going</em>?”</p>

<p>“Six o’clock train back to town this evening,”
said the Governor, looking steadily at me.</p>

<p>A “Thank goodness!” remained unuttered
on the tip of my tongue, as I felt obliged to say,
“I hope he didn’t think it odd of me not to want
to see”—I brought it out with a jerk—“that
house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! He seemed rather bucked, really,
to hear that—well, that we were so far on
in our plans. Anglesey, you know, and so on,”
said the Governor, in an expressionless voice as
I turned quickly away.</p>

<p>For I’d caught the heralding whiff of a cigar
round the corner! Also, I wanted to be safely
in my own room, getting ready for church, just
at the time that those two men would be setting
out for the links.</p>

<p>My employer took one step after me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“This evening, then?—I mean, for what I
was going to say to you.”</p>

<p>Ah. That interrupted apology weighed on
his mind.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>And I drew a breath of relief to think of the
whole blessed Day of Rest before me.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>Even Church, however, wasn’t without its
slight reminder of the situation.</p>

<p>I was feeling rested, soothed, lulled—and, I am
afraid, not strictly attentive—when my attention
was caught, first by Theo’s moist palm being
thrust into mine, much as Cariad thrusts his
nose, and then by a phrase in the voice of the
officiating curate:</p>

<p>“<i>I publish the banns of marriage between</i>——”</p>

<p>Banns, of course! Of course they must needs
publish banns on this particular Sunday and
in this particular church! thought I, rather
pettishly. Well, I supposed it wasn’t really
the Governor’s fault! and that there <em>are</em> banns
read every week! The next words I heard were:</p>

<p>“<i>Also of Leonard Harris, bachelor</i>—”</p>

<p>Ah! I knew his name; it was the young man
from the Waters’ butcher, who, as I had already
been told, was to marry the prettiest of the maids
at The Lawn, the one who was sweeping the
stairs this morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>—“<i>and Ethel Mary Bell, spinster, both of this
parish.</i>”</p>

<p>Both absurdly happy, probably, in a
“Smithie” kind of way. I wondered if “he”
were red and greasy, like so many butchers?
Whether he’d leave “her” at home while he
went and sat all the evening in the “Spotted
Dog”?</p>

<p>My young man—I suppose to some people
the Governor <em>would</em> be my “young man”—isn’t
that sort. Not that it need make the
slightest difference to <em>me</em> if he were! I needn’t
worry about the sort of husband he’ll make—to
someone else.</p>

<p>“<i>Also between</i>——”</p>

<p>What a lot of engaged couples! Six, at
least, were “called” to-day. And I wondered
about each of those six engaged girls....
Which of them had bloomed out into what
books call “<i>this strange new happiness that had
come to her</i>” on HIS account, and which of them
just wanted to be “engaged” for its own sake?</p>

<p>For supposing an engagement were stripped
of all its glamour of importance? Yes, my
dears! Take away the delight of discussing,
with other girls, the possibilities of finest nainsook
and torchon. Take away the chance of
growing positively left-handed from showing off
“his” ring. Take away the joy of being, instead
of an unattended wallflower at dances and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
parties, always more or less of a guarded treasure.
Take away that feeling of being at one and the
same time much younger, much older and much
better-looking. Take away the comforting conviction
that <em>now</em> you needn’t fret about what’s
to become of you when you grow <i lang="fr">passée</i> and
“long in the tooth,” as Major Montresor
unkindly calls various ex-favourites of his own.
Take all those “extras” away—and what
remains of your pride and joy in HIM alone?
There’s a sum for the “really” engaged girl.
I can’t help feeling I can guess how it would
work out in—say, four cases out of six!</p>

<p>Perhaps I’m wrong.... Perhaps the whole
six of them would still go on feeling that <em>their</em>
unparalleled engagement had caused the sun to
rise upon a new heaven and a brand-new earth.
But it’s odds, long odds, against any one of the
six having an “affair” in the least like—<em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>And the curate went on reading out names.</p>

<p>“<i>Also</i>——”</p>

<p>“<i>Between William Waters, bachelor, of this
parish</i>,” breathed his younger sister in a gusty
whisper, “<i>and Nancy Monica Trant, spinster</i>—of
the parish of what, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“S-sh! Theo!” I whispered, still wondering
about those banns.... Would it come to
that? Would my employer feel himself obliged,
before our twelve-months’ contract was up, to
let those banns be actually published?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“<i>If any of you know any just cause or impediment
why these persons should not be joined together in
Holy Matrimony</i>,” concluded the curate’s voice,
“<i>ye are to declare it</i>.”</p>

<p>What in the world <em>was</em> Mr. Waters going
to “declare” about it to his family when we
reached that point? What just cause or impediment
(except the real ones) would he choose
to “announce” as the bar to our getting
married? Or would he, just as he did this
morning at breakfast, leave all explanations to
<em>me</em>, and reward me with a grateful look when I’d
achieved them?</p>

<p>Well!...</p>

<p>Plenty of time before <em>that</em> happens....</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>To-night, though, there’d be that other
explanation: his to me about that—really, under
the circumstances it might be called that <em>outrage</em>!
Even yet I hadn’t made up my mind how I was
to accept what he should say. The only thing
left standing of all the many answers I’d considered
and rejected was, “Well, it must never
happen again, that’s all!”</p>

<p>Even that doesn’t sound right, somehow.</p>

<p>Perhaps something really clinching will occur
to me later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was almost at the end of this Day of Rest
that the Governor, extra sunburnt and out-of-door-looking
from the links, returned to find
the women-folk of his household—to which I
suppose I must count myself as belonging
officially—sitting over that diminuendo of
half-cups that marks the end of tea.</p>

<p>“Has your uncle gone, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes; met some old crony of his and joined
him for the journey home. If you tell me
where his bag is I’ll get it sent down to the
station to meet the six, Mother?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to it now.”</p>

<p>She went out of the drawing-room—I <em>know</em>
with the usual gentle intention of leaving the
young people a minute to themselves after
having been apart all day; but before Theodora
and Blanche could follow her, the Governor,
saying that he simply must change and get this
dust off, disappeared himself.</p>

<p>He disappeared until supper-time.</p>

<p>For late Sunday supper they don’t dress
at The Lawn. So I was still wearing my
cream cloth costume with the white French
blouse that Mrs. Waters likes when the hour
came which is given over to my official
<i lang="fr">fiancé</i> and myself. I’m quite hardened to
this now.</p>

<p>I supposed he would suggest the den. (I
hate that den.) But he didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“Shall we go for a walk?” he said instead,
“round the lawn?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Shall I fetch you a wrap to put over that
frock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It’s perfectly warm, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Oh.... Very well.”</p>

<p>And so, at the dusk of the day, just as in the
morning sunshine of it, I found myself pacing
a garden path by his side, and wishing to goodness
he’d get this over, out of the way.</p>

<p>He ought to be made to <em>grovel</em>, of course;
that was as it should be.</p>

<p>But the longer he delayed mentioning that
grotesque incident, the more it <em>loomed</em>!</p>

<p>It seemed to hang over my head like the shade
of the trees that bordered the further edge of
the lawn, which we had now reached. The
great spread of turf was gleaming greyly in the
dew. A bat, attracted by the whiteness of my
gown, flickered out of the shade and wheeled
above us.</p>

<p>“Well,” began the Governor, “my uncle
left all sorts of messages for you.”</p>

<p>He would, of course. Carefully refraining
from asking what they were, I said mildly,
“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“He’s back in London by now.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose if he’d stayed on much longer,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
observed my employer, in a detached tone,
“<em>you wouldn’t</em>!”</p>

<p>I said defensively, “I really <em>had</em> been thinking
I might find myself obliged to go back to town
at once!”</p>

<p>“After arranging to stay here for at least a
fortnight,” he concluded quietly; “after having
given notice at the office—”</p>

<p>“The office” was good! Just as if “the
office” meant anything but himself, Mr. William
Waters!</p>

<p>—“and having no people of your own to
consider—what should you have said to mine?”</p>

<p>“I should have had to tell them that it was
to—to attend a funeral!” I retorted, with a
memory of Mrs. Skinner. “Or”—here I
checked the suggestion of getting my hair
singed and cut. I thought I’d better not begin
by mentioning my hair! And I added recklessly—“or
that I’d got to go to the dentist’s
and have every one of my teeth out!”</p>

<p>“Rather than stay here in these circumstances.
I see. Yes. I——Do you know, I
have felt uncommonly like that myself,” admitted
my employer. “That’s what I’ve been wanting
to talk to you about. I thought it over last
night, as I told you, and I’ve been thinking about
it again to-day.”</p>

<p>I wondered what sort of a game of golf he’d
played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“It can’t go on like this!” he said, suddenly
stopping in our stroll and facing me in the
deepening dusk under the copper-beech. “I
can’t stand it. It’s got a—a bit too thick!” he
concluded, quite schoolboyishly.</p>

<p>Then he began again, incoherently, indignantly,
as if each word he said were a shell that
held showers of bullets of other words.</p>

<p>“Theo’s tomfoolery! Those dashed flowers!
My uncle and his—his remarks!”</p>

<p>“I know!” I said fervently. He turned on
me again, and added unexpectedly, “And
<em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“M-me?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” explosively. “You’re the worst of
all—and you do know it! Because I’ve let you
in like, this—”</p>

<p>“They’ll hear you from the house—you
really are like Theo sometimes.”</p>

<p>—“Because I’ve let you in,” sinking his voice
and speaking once more calmly and deliberately,
“for lots of unpleasantnesses which nobody
could have—well, which <em>I</em> never anticipated—you
do all in your power to pay me back!”</p>

<p>“All that—at dinner last night,” I said
virtuously, “was nothing to do with me. You
can’t say it was.”</p>

<p>“No, I admit it was Theo.... But it
was all part and parcel of the same impossible
situation. Impossible! It can’t go on like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“So you said before! But this morning you
said you were unable to release me?”</p>

<p>“So I am. Which means that there’s only
one other thing to be done about it,” said my
employer.</p>

<p>I waited, wondering what on earth this might be.</p>

<p>Utterly unexpected was his next remark:</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you could manage to be—<em>friends</em>
with me?”</p>

<p>“<em>Friends?</em>” I repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>Then something of his meaning began to dawn
upon me, and it was with a return of Manner B
that I added: “I suppose you mean ‘official’
friends?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” he said rather tartly. (That
manner never has been lost on him.) “I mean,
why can’t we be really friends and call ‘<i>Pax</i>’—for
at least the time that you’re here? Don’t
you see how much better it would make it if
we could face these awkwardnesses together,
instead of my knowing every time that you are
only waiting for the chance to rub it in and to
get at me?”</p>

<p>This was all so foreign to his Near Oriental
vocabulary that I nearly laughed. But not
quite. For it was being borne in upon me still
more clearly that I didn’t care for this suggestion
of his at all. He was actually asking for my help
and co-operation, not in a sham rôle, but a <em>real</em>
one? Well, I thought, what <em>cheek</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“If you mean,” I said, “that you want me to
promise not to ‘rag’—not to—to banter you
again about all this; not to go on saying things
that mean one thing for you and another to whoever
else hears them, and all that——”</p>

<p>I was going to say that this I might promise;
although I felt he was asking for a good deal—for
his official <i lang="fr">fiancée’s</i> one safety-valve, in fact!</p>

<p>“No, no! That’s not what I mean,” he put
in. “When I say ‘friends,’ I mean it. Genuine
friends. On the terms we might be on if we
weren’t en—if we hadn’t this ‘engagement’
between us.”</p>

<p>“How <em>can</em> we be that?” said I emphatically.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Why? Because I—I don’t see how I could
be expected to answer such a question!”</p>

<p>He didn’t <em>say</em>, “You agreed to the other!”
But I knew some men might. So I went on trying
to explain to this specially obtuse one.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see how much easier it is to pretend
to be engaged or even—in love with a
person, than to turn round and <em>like</em> them because
you’re asked to?”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p>“But of <em>course</em> it is!” said I. “One <em>can</em> act
being—engaged and all that. One can’t force
oneself into friendship, real liking.” (Stupid,
he was; it was just like his not seeing the difference
between accepting furs—and a frock!)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
“One simply can’t make oneself <em>like</em>. That is
asking too much. And I never bargained for
it. It wasn’t——”</p>

<p>—“In the arrangement,” I nearly said.</p>

<p>I might just as well have said it! For:</p>

<p>“Damn—dash that infernal arrangement!”
muttered my employer heatedly, crunching, in
the absence of Cariad, the well-kept gravel beneath
his heel. “Can’t you forget that, leave
that alone for the time being? It would be so
much easier——”</p>

<p>“Yes! For you perhaps!” I retorted.
“But not easy for me; and it’s impossible for
me to feel like being ‘friends’ to order!”</p>

<p>He said nothing for a minute. Then he began
again quietly. “You mean you dislike me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know you well enough for really
liking or disliking,” I argued coldly. “And
besides, what have we—you and I—in common,
that we should expect to get on well together?”</p>

<p>I knew what a hopeless question <em>that</em> is to
answer about almost any two persons!</p>

<p>He said rather helplessly, “Well, but hang it
all! What have you in common with——”</p>

<p>Here I <em>felt</em>, suspended between us in the dusk
like a Mahomet’s coffin, the name of Sydney
Vandeleur!</p>

<p>But the Governor changed his mind about
uttering it.</p>

<p>He <em>said</em>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“For instance, what can you have in common
with a man like Montresor? You’re twenty-one.
He’s what?—Fifty? Sixty? Yet you
can talk—you can——You seem to get on all
right with him.”</p>

<p>“Naturally!” I said.</p>

<p>The Governor said nothing.</p>

<p>He put up a hand and leaned against a bough
of the copper-beech under which we were
standing.</p>

<p>Well! It seemed going to be a long discussion.</p>

<p>I sat down on the garden bench a step or so
away, and turned my head to look at the glimmering
white trumpets of a tobacco-plant that
grew behind the bench. The only form in
which tobacco smells anything but poisonous!
And there were such beds of it at home ...
in the evening it scented all the grounds....</p>

<p>“Major Montresor, as he told you, knew me
in my home, knew all my people,” I went on
slowly. “He knew all the places I went to before
I had to drop out of everything that I cared for
and had to slave for my own living in that
detestable City of yours.”</p>

<p>“You speak as if <em>I</em> owned the City—as if
I were responsible for your having had to work
there—for the whole thing! Is that fair?
Must you go on making me stand for all that?
Supposing it hadn’t been there at all that you
first met me, Nancy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>For the first time the name slipped out from
my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> quite naturally.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” he went on, “that we
might have managed to get on moderately well
then?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” said I. I <em>wanted</em> to keep
him on that strictly business footing. This
other I didn’t want. I knew it would take
something from me, and give me nothing—nothing
to stand up for myself with—in its place.</p>

<p>“Try to imagine,” he persisted, “that I’d
known you in your home, like that chap—what’s-his-name—”</p>

<p>The name—Vandeleur—flickered between us
once more like that bat in the air!</p>

<p>—“like Montresor. Imagine that you’d never
been at the Near Oriental—never heard of the
place. I’m sure I often wish <em>I</em> hadn’t,” the
Governor’s voice came ruefully out of the dusk.
“Then, instead of this eternal sparring—”</p>

<p>“My only refuge,” I thought, “and he’s
trying to turn me out of it!”</p>

<p>—“there might surely have been something
distinctly resembling friendship between us?”
he said.</p>

<p>I said obstinately, “Might there? I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>He moved. There wasn’t enough light to
see his face. Only his collar made a white blur
against the branch, and the broad slope of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
shoulders showed dark against the sky that had
deepened from lilac to purple.</p>

<p>“But I know,” he said quietly, “that you
could—that you <em>could</em> be——”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“Well?” I said, rather uncomfortably. “I
could be what?”</p>

<p>“Rather a little brick to me if you chose,” said
the Governor.</p>

<p>I am sure it slipped out without his meaning
it to. <em>He</em> would have been ready to go on arguing
quite logically about “how much more
sensible” et cetera.... How there was “absolutely
no valid reason why it shouldn’t” and so
forth ... for another hour!</p>

<p><em>He</em> can’t know how the key of a logical
argument will fumble forever at the locked safe-door
of a woman’s mind that could just fly open
to the cipher spelt “Appreciation.”</p>

<p>—“Rather a little brick.”</p>

<p>So he did think me capable of that?</p>

<p>I was glad of the dark under the copper-beech.
For I didn’t want my employer to see
that his words had any sort of effect on me.
Four words ought not, certainly, to be enough
to threaten to bring one’s flag down with a
run ... or even to flush one’s cheeks with
that sudden warmth—of surprise. I didn’t
mean to hesitate——</p>

<p>But there was a moment’s silence before I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
could think what to say. I was glad he was
standing right away from me....</p>

<p>Just at that, he came and sat down beside me
on the garden-seat.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said expectantly.</p>

<p>“M-m—very well,” I heard myself say with
a little sigh.</p>

<p>“You mean that you will?”—quickly.
“That it’s peace between us?”</p>

<p>“Yes—” reluctantly, from me.</p>

<p>“And that, instead of remaining”—I heard
him laugh a little—“a mere <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, you’ll be
friends now—real chums?”</p>

<p>“If you like,” I sighed again. “That <em>is</em>
promotion, isn’t it?” I said, not meaning to
be altogether too polite to him.</p>

<p>“Nancy, I know I’m rotten in lots of ways,”
he admitted frankly. “I daresay you think I’ve
got a beast of a temper, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said slowly, “you did kick Cariad,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Little brute needs it! He’s disgustingly spoilt.
Everyone is who belongs to my mother.” ...</p>

<p>“And you did make Theo cry!”</p>

<p>“Did her good!”</p>

<p>“It didn’t in the least! She was just as bad
again to-day!”</p>

<p>“Was she, by Jove? Then I shall have
to——”</p>

<p>“No, no, she wasn’t. I mean, <em>you</em> are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, but I’m—<em>we’re</em> going to turn over a
new leaf!” he said, laughing. “That’s settled,
isn’t it? Good! This is going to be no end
better, all round.”</p>

<p>All very well for <em>him</em> to say so! I thought,
as I got up and turned towards the dim, blue-white
front of the house with the dark girdle of
the veranda circling it, and the windows, now
lighted up, set into it like a chain of long, rosy
jewels.</p>

<p>He rose too.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said, straightening himself a head
and shoulders above me. “Do we shake hands
on that, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said I.</p>

<p>What else was there to say or do?</p>

<p><em>I</em> don’t consider it’s going to be “better all
round.” For me it will be ever so much more
awkward—as well as something—yes!—something
like a <em>climb-down</em>.</p>

<p>Still——</p>

<p>As he held out his hand I put my own into
a particularly warm and hearty grip.</p>

<p>It was the very first time we’d shaken hands
at all.</p>

<p>Last night a kiss on the hair!</p>

<p>To-night, a handshake!...</p>

<p>And, in spite of all I’d expected, he’d never
once mentioned that kiss.</p>

<p>I suppose he won’t now.</p>

</div>

<p>Often, when I’ve imagined something was
going to be so easy and delightful, it’s
turned out to involve every kind of difficulty
and unpleasantness. Like earning my own
living in the City. And then other things,
which I’ve foreseen as such odious and constant
worries, have proved to be not nearly so bad after
all; in fact, quite amusing—that’s like agreeing
to be “friends—real chums” with my
employer Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>He’s really quite—I don’t know how to put
it—<em>different</em>.</p>

<p>I know he’s trying to be “decent” to me,
and yet not trying hard enough to make me
feel it’s my duty to “play up” and to be
unnaturally sweet in return.</p>

<p>Instead, I am beginning to feel that I shall
soon be able to like him genuinely, just as I like
Blanche and Theo, though perhaps not quite
as well as I like his mother, who seems more of a
darling every day.</p>

<p>This morning after I came back from driving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
to the station with the Governor, she called me,
and I went into the little tiny room off the
drawing-room, which is furnished only with one
deep chair and her writing-table, but of which
each wall is simply covered with framed
photographs of her children at every stage.</p>

<p>She was sitting at the writing-table, with a
pile of letters to answer.</p>

<p>“Sit in the big chair, Nancy. I won’t keep
you more than a minute,” she said, turning to
me, “but I wanted to speak to you. It’s about
our summer plans, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I began. The fortnight which
I’d arranged to spend at The Lawn—and which
seems about three months now!—is up to-morrow.
I was just going to remind her of
this, when she said, “We all—not only Billy!—are
so anxious that you shall stay on, Nancy.
You will, won’t you, if you haven’t made
other arrangements?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve made none,” I said, hesitating
both in my official and unofficial capacities.
I didn’t <em>mind</em> staying on, now. Still—ought I
to do it?</p>

<p>“We have only a week or so,” said Mrs.
Waters, “before we go away to the sea. That
is, the girls and I are off on Saturday week to
Anglesey.”</p>

<p>“To Porth Cariad?” I said. “Isn’t that
the place—he told me about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; Billy’s so fond of it! It’s just a tiny
place with a station and a post-office and a
handful of cottages. We take the two cottages
nearest the sea, and let just the woman and her
daughter ‘do’ for us. He likes that so much
better than going to a ‘resort’ with hotels
and esplanades and things.”</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters gave me a pleased, girlish smile.</p>

<p>“Then, if you do too, you’ll come, won’t
you? He didn’t seem sure whether”—she
laughed a little—“whether it mightn’t bore you
rather; but he made me promise to ask you.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>“I should like it very much,” I said sincerely,
for, since this revised version of my
relations with Mr. Waters, there’s an end of
any more complications for the present. It
has been worth while sinking the small satisfactions
of being “cattish” and making two-edged
remarks to my employer. I seem, now,
to have all the advantages of being engaged to a
quite friendly and easy-to-get-on-with young
man, without the horrible disadvantage of
feeling it’s a permanency. Yes; I do like
having the freedom of a man’s conversation
and society without <i lang="fr">arrière pensée</i>. And it
seems to me that the only way to enjoy them is
by being officially—that is, <em>nominally</em>, engaged to
the man! In any other sort of acquaintanceship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
there looms the possibility of the “Real” engagement.
All the time that the girl and the man are
having what might be a jolly and unembarrassed
conversation about really interesting things—not
Love and nonsense—that possibility is being
conjugated between them by some horrid form
of Conscience or Self-consciousness. Something
like this:</p>

<p>“<i>I might fall in love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Thou mightest fall in love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>She might think I was falling in love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>He might imagine I wanted him to fall in
love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>We might both fall in love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>You might tease us about being in love.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>They might say we were actually engaged!</i>”</p>

<p>All this we—Mr. Waters and I—are spared.
The feeling of it, which is there like a brick
wall between almost every unattached young
man and young woman, I know; I’ve felt it
there between Sydney and myself, long, long
before I knew he admired me.</p>

<p>And this same wall—well, it’s not so much
that it’s never been built, or even that it’s
been pulled down, as that it’s not <em>between</em> Mr.
Waters and me, just because we’re sitting on
the top of it and talking all the more comfortably
for having climbed it together!</p>

<p>Consequently, I really was pleased to accept
Mrs. Waters’ invitation. And when she said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
further, “Billy won’t be able to join us for a
fortnight, I’m afraid. Will you go back, dear,
to this friend of yours you live with in London,
and come on later? Or—of course you know
we should love it!—could you come with
Blanche and Theo and me?” I said, “Do let
me come with you and the girls.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the Governor’s mother.
“Then I shall write to Mrs. Roberts at the
cottages, and tell her to have the extra bedroom
in <em>my</em> cottage ready for you.”</p>

<p>“And I will write to Cicely Harradine—that’s
the girl I live with,” said I. “And I ought
to go up one day this week to the flat, and see
her and collect a few things.”</p>

<p>“Go up on Saturday, dear,” suggested the
Governor’s mother. “Then Billy could motor
you up; he would like that so much.”</p>

<p>She has so many plans of this kind for me,
fostered by this delusion that her son is
always on the look-out for a chance to be alone
with me.</p>

<p>Of course it’s not quite the same kind of
delusion now that it was a week ago.</p>

<p>The Governor’s “Good!” when he heard
that I was going to spend the summer holidays
with them at that curiously-named place in
Anglesey was quite as sincere in its way, I do
believe, as Theo’s “<em>Joy!</em> Oh, it will be twice
as lovely as usual with Nancy there to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
everything to!” He wasn’t the least bored,
either, when Mrs. Waters put forward the plan
of his motoring me up to town.</p>

<p>“Rather! A good idea,” he said briskly.
“What about starting earlier after lunch, and
doing a matinée this afternoon? You’ve
never been to the theatre with me yet, Nancy,
and—we talked about that one day.”</p>

<p>“So we did,” said I demurely, remembering
that grisly occasion at the Carlton.</p>

<p>“Well, would you care about it?”</p>

<p>“I should! Why! I haven’t been to the
theatre for ages. I haven’t seen anything; not
even <cite>Milestones</cite>!”</p>

<p>“Care for that?”</p>

<p>“Anything, so long as it’s a play!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll ’phone up now for seats.”</p>

<p>And as he spoke through the telephone that
is fixed up in the den, I had almost a start at
what seemed to me the strangeness of my
employer’s voice. Yet that curt, metallic
“<i>Hullo!</i>” used to be familiar enough to me—the
only tone of his voice, indeed, that I’d ever
heard!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>Passing the long waiting queue at the gallery
entrance to the Royalty this afternoon, I glanced
idly towards all those people who had stood
for over an hour, probably, to get a shilling seat;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
the playgoers to whom I myself belonged a
couple of months ago. Yet I never felt I’d
belonged to them.... I suppose no woman,
from a factory-hand to a viscountess, feels that
she really “belongs” to any but the life of
luxury. I don’t believe men feel that as
strongly—and yet it’s they who are supposed
to be the more finished and civilized sex. I
must ask Mr. Waters, now that I know him well
enough, what he thinks about this?</p>

<p>I was just wondering, when, out of that
mosaic of black and coloured pattern formed
by the crowd, there turned with one movement
three dabs of colour, three cheap, effective
little hats; and three girlish faces, alight with
amusement and recognition, were lifted towards
us.</p>

<p>They nodded and smiled; and I, leaning
forward out of the car, was just in time to wave
my hand to them.</p>

<p>“Friends of yours?” said my employer,
glancing back as he raised his hat!</p>

<p>“Why, yes! Didn’t you know them?”</p>

<p>“No! Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Because you see them every day,” I laughed.
“They were Miss Robinson, Miss Holt and
Miss Smith from your office.”</p>

<p>“No? By Jove,” said Mr. Waters, rather
blankly. Which surprised me rather, as I
remembered his care that “the other typists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
should know for a fact” with whom I was going
out, that first time of all.</p>

<p>I was conscious, though I couldn’t see where
they sat in the gallery, that their three pairs of
eyes must be glued to us in our front-row stalls.
Nothing could have been more conventional
than our appearance—we were absolutely the
model of a prosperous young engaged couple
up from the suburbs; I, prettily dressed, with
the inevitable box of chocolates on my lap; he,
good tempered and easy of manner, paying me
all the customary attentions of programme,
helping me off with my coat, seeing that I had
opera-glasses, the best seat, and so on, and yet—apart
from the “official engagement” side of
it, how <em>really</em> unconventional was our relation!</p>

<p>So much more satisfactory under the circumstances
than a real engagement! Or that pie-bald thing,
an understanding! Or that other
form of platonic friendship which either the
girl or the man is always hoping, or fearing, may
turn into something else!</p>

<p>The curtain went up to the soft strains of a
tune which I, who have had to play accompaniments
to so many songs, didn’t know.... But
beside us and behind us there were old ladies
who murmured, “Ah! ‘<cite>She wore a Wreath
of Roses.</cite>’”</p>

<p>The play began, and I forgot everything else
for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>In the first interval we amused ourselves by
looking at the audience. They were nearly
<em>all</em> elderly ladies! As the Governor remarked,
“Nancy! Yours and mine are the only heads
for three rows of seats that aren’t grey-haired
or covered with bonnets!”</p>

<p>“They’ve come to catch echoes of their past,”
I murmured flippantly as those tunes from the
<cite>Mikado</cite> sent the curtain up on Act II.</p>

<p>That finished my flippancy for me.</p>

<p>In what seemed like hours afterwards I heard
Mr. Waters’ voice, cool and detached, saying
something about good acting and soothing syrup
and the most sentimental public in the world,
then breaking off suddenly, anxiously to exclaim,
“What is it, Nancy? Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p>“Of c-course I am! I’m only enjoying
myself!” I sobbed quietly; tears dripping
down on to the pleated frill of my afternoon
blouse. “I think it’s p-perfectly lovely!”
And I dabbed my face with the powder-puff
swathed in my handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Rum idea of enjoyment,” said the Governor
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Not a bit rum,” I argued, having steadied
myself again. “You don’t know much about
girls—they’re mostly like that—ask any of them—ask
any of the other typists in your office!”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve never looked upon those
as ‘girls,’” said he. “They’re—machines!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
machines that eat cherries all day long and chuck
the stones all over the floor. Such inefficient
ones, too; they——Why d’you laugh, Nancy!
I say, you know quite well I don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“Ssh!” came indignantly from under the
bonnet—trimmed with squashed heliotropes and
doddering jet beads—on the other side of him,
as the band struck up the rollicking two-step
that heralds the twentieth-century act.</p>

<p>I didn’t cry any more, though.</p>

<p>I believe I was actually less taken up with
what was on the stage than with the oddness
of my having been behind two sets of scenes
myself; with those girls who “couldn’t possibly
look upon Still Waters as ‘a man,’ exactly”
and then with this man who never really considered
typists as “girls.” When had he left
off considering me as just a typist? How
soon before that evening when we became
friends?</p>

<p>Once more I felt grateful to that evening’s
compact, as I followed the tall figure with that
slight dip from the broad shoulders in to the
waist—that line so painfully cultivated by Major
Montresor!—and let it make a path for me
out of the theatre and to the waiting car.</p>

<p>I believe I’ve always really hated going about
London alone, or with just another girl!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Now, then! Rumpelmayer’s, or the Piccadilly,
or where, for tea, Nancy, before I take you
on to your friend’s?”</p>

<p>“I meant to have tea with her,” I explained.
“I was going on in the bus, and getting down
to Sevenoaks afterwards by the dinner-train;
saying good-bye to you here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, were you! Why not take me along
too?” he suggested, looking down at me.</p>

<p>Well! Why shouldn’t he realize in what
sort of places these machines called working-girls
live? He’d heard about the lawns and
gardens, and so forth, of my old home. Let him
see the change I’d had before—well, before that
first interview in his office. Then there was
Cicely. Yes, when I left her she was still rather
“difficult” about my engagement—rather given
to unspoken hopes that I wasn’t doing it for the
money. Let her see that my (official) <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>
was quite a human sort of young man—the sort
that some girls really might get engaged to without
a thought of his income!</p>

<p>“My chum is a very pretty girl,” said I;
“<em>she’s</em> worth looking at——”</p>

<p>“Fair?”</p>

<p>“No, glorious red hair.”</p>

<p>“Well, take me along and let me look at it!”
he urged boyishly; and presently we were
speeding along down the Embankment towards
Marconi Mansions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>I had my latch-key in my vanity-bag. I
opened the door at the top of the many stone
steps and led the way into the passage, which
seemed about as light and wide as a good-sized
drainpipe after that airy, tiled vestibule at
The Lawn. Meaning to take Cicely by surprise,
I quietly walked into our small front sitting-room.</p>

<p>But it was Cicely who took me by surprise.</p>

<p>She had, already, a visitor for tea.</p>

<p>Thick cigarette-smoke made a blue haze above
the jumble of odd bits of furniture which we’d
picked up second-hand in the Old King’s Road,
above the tea-table with its Persian Rose pottery,
its plate of Chelsea buns and its green dish of
cherries—I hoped there weren’t many stones
on the floor!—a haze that half obscured Cicely’s
bright head and the figure that reclined, opposite
to her, in our comfiest basket-chair. I saw by
the unusual garments of it that it must be—yes!
Sydney Vandeleur!</p>

<p>Really, I don’t know which of the four of us
was least pleased to see the others, while I introduced
Mr. Waters to Cicely and said gaily to
the men, “I think you’ve met before” ... and
forced myself to dissipate the odious pause that
followed the insincerely civil greetings by plunging
into some sort of conversation.</p>

<p>It was worst for me, I think. I was so utterly
taken aback—first, by finding Sydney there at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
all, and then by wondering what on earth the
Governor would think of his being there—<em>and
in those clothes</em>!</p>

<p>For Sydney’s latest idea for not being slavishly
got-up like every other miserably conventional
tailor’s dummy was, apparently, to have his
“things” more or less a copy, but an <i lang="fr">édition
de luxe</i>, of a French fisher-boy’s <i lang="fr">vareuse</i>-blouse
and skirt-like trousers; those brown corduroys
were of corduroy-velvet at goodness knows
what a yard, cut by some master-hand in Savile
Row; the very bagginess at the ankles, above
the leaf-brown silk socks, had been carefully
studied. And the Governor!—who’d once
said:</p>

<p>“<i>After all, what’s unusual in dress is wrong,
nine times out of ten. Eight times, it’s also
hideous.</i>”</p>

<p>He must be positively flabbergasted at this
spectacle! I’m more accustomed to those ideas;
but even I found it a relief to turn my eyes upon
his stereotyped grey suit after that fell and deadly
“<i>effectiveness</i>” of Sydney’s....</p>

<p>Posing in his dress like that! Posing, even
more shamelessly, in his manner!</p>

<p>For wouldn’t you have thought that anyone
who’d been refused by a girl and who then
came unexpectedly face to face with that girl
and the person for whom he imagines she’s
jilted him—<em>wouldn’t</em> you suppose that he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
at least behave like a man? Take it without
flinching, even if it were fairly unpleasant, and
carry it off as if nothing particular had happened?
<em>I</em> shall never think the same of Sydney again
for not doing that.</p>

<p>Perhaps it served me right for the rather
spiteful note I wrote to him just before I went
off to The Lawn, but—Need he have committed
the solecism of calling me, when I’ve never
been anything but “Monica” to him, “<i>Miss
Trant</i>” in italics? It was trying! So was
the pathetic look which he saw fit to call up
into his spanielly brown eyes as he glanced from
me to Mr. Waters. (Mask well down there,
so I couldn’t guess what <em>he</em> made of this velvet-and-Vandyke
apparition.) And the worm-in-the-bud
expression which Sydney let steal over
the whole of his dreamy, Cavalier’s face as he
turned it, in a way that all but said “Ah! You
understand what I suffer!” to Cicely——</p>

<p>Cicely, too! <em>Cicely</em>, who’s shared ups and
downs with me for the last two years! Even she
must needs forsake me, making matters worse
by creating a general atmosphere of blight even
while she was bringing in two more leadless-glaze
cups and plates, and making fresh tea, and
by giving an accurate though unspoken impression
of what she “understood.”</p>

<p>“Yes! I am the looker-on at this game. I
see it all! The sensitive, artistic soul—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>(This is what she thinks of Sydney.)</p>

<p>—“torn by the sight of this hopelessly stodgy,
commonplace young man—”</p>

<p>(I know that this is how she sums up my friend
Mr. Waters.)</p>

<p>—“being preferred to himself! Ah, Love
is blind!”</p>

<p>(Meaning me.)</p>

<p>“And people never seem to recognize the
right man until it’s too late.”</p>

<p>(Deluded little donkey!)</p>

<p>We had tea. What a meal!</p>

<p>“You do take sugar in it, don’t you, Tots?”
plaintively from Cicely, with a side-effect of,
“She’s so deplorably altered in everything else,
I don’t know what any of her tastes may be
now!”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Waters take it?” (To <em>me</em>!)</p>

<p>“Not any, thanks,” from the Governor.
“Only milk.”</p>

<p>Cicely’s glance commented silently, “Ah!
Incompatibility latent here! An unhappy
marriage!”</p>

<p>Why, why hadn’t I said I’d like to go to
Rumpelmayer’s, or Lyons’—or Lockhart’s?
Anything rather than this funereal feast, with
Sydney Vandeleur as the skeleton thereat!
Even if he’d remained a voiceless skeleton!
But, cheered by all the subtle encouragement
and moral support from his pretty hostess—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
must say Cicely was looking prettier than ever!—Sydney
began to recover a little, relaxed his
first pose of open broken-heartedness, and proceeded
to <em>talk</em>.</p>

<p>Nobody else did. Mr. Waters looked as if
nothing was going to force his lips asunder
again. I didn’t want to say anything. Cicely
was quite happy to listen. And Sydney held
forth.</p>

<p>He began with—“Have you been to—” and
“Haven’t you seen—” various picture-galleries
and pieces of an “advanced” type.</p>

<p>“What! Not seen ‘<cite>The Keening of Deidre</cite>,’
even? But why not?” he protested to me,
lolling back in that chair as if he didn’t possess
a spine. “Oh, it’s such a wonderful thing; so
subtle and so brutal at the same time. And
one’s sure of seeing everyone one wants to see, in
the pit; a positive At Home of them. Better
than the dear old palmy days of the Sicilians.
I have been three times. The whole effect is
so—so sculptured! You would love it! Oh,
you must take her”—this to my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>,
who sat silent and non-committal and very bolt-upright.
“You really must not miss it. It is
coming off next week.”</p>

<p>“I’m going away next week,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes? To the country?”</p>

<p>“To Wales.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Wales! It used to be so wild and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
charming and remote—almost as good as those
perfectly untrodden tracts we still get in the
West of Ireland. But it’s frightfully overdone
now,” complained Sydney. “One doesn’t know
if it’s the fault of Lloyd George, or the picture
postcards, or that appalling little railway up
Snowdon, but Wales has become so <em>obvious</em>.
When I’m going over to Ballycool, do you know,
I have to read all the way in the train between
Chester and Holyhead, in terror lest I should
inadvertently catch sight of any of the ‘scenery.’
I assure you”—to Cicely—“that when you get
that Snowdon Range, cut out in purple cardboard
jig-saws against what the dear tourists
call ‘a glorious sunset’ it’s almost exactly like
a landscape in the Academy!”</p>

<p>“How <em>perfectly</em> dreadful!” sympathized
Cicely—little humbug! who, only last year,
used to mark her favourite pictures in the
Academy Catalogue. I do hate a girl’s tastes
to be mere echoes of the man she’s with!</p>

<p>“And those ruined castles; they’re really
almost too priceless to be true,” enlarged
Sydney. “Turrets like this”—he zig-zagged
with a finger in the air, while a gold curb bracelet
chinked at his slim wrist—“reflected, wherever
possible, in water. Terrible! I mean, you
simply <em>have</em> to laugh! You feel the landscape
transforming itself into wings and a drop-scene
before your eyes! And the ‘Elephant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Mountain’ that they insist on pointing out to
you, because it really <em>is</em> so like an elephant’s back!
(Such an attraction!). And then those <em>meaty</em>
pink clouds that they always contrive to get so
symmetrically posed <em>just</em> behind the summit
of Snowdon! Snowdon itself is so hopelessly
banal that it only just falls short of perfection.
Excruciating! Cader Idris, now, is a little
better,” he went on kindly. “It is still possible
to introduce Cader to one’s friends. Cader,
with that quaint lake they have there, remains
quite an attractive mountain, I think”—turning
to Mr. Waters, who still looked as if <em>he</em> couldn’t
think of anything to say to this person who
patted the Welsh mountains, so to speak, on the
head.</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to be among the mountains,”
he announced briefly. “My people generally
settle for six weeks or so in Anglesey.”</p>

<p>“Not really? How amusing—I mean, it’s
really possible to ‘settle’ there?” said Sydney
Vandeleur, lifting his dark Vandyke beard from
his tie—heavens, what a tie! I’d only just
noticed that. “One had always looked upon
Anglesey as a sort of straight line leading to the
North Wall.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said the Governor, who, having
checked a “Can-such-things-be?” start, was
obviously trying to keep his eyes off that tie
of Sydney’s: a bunch of amber silk, patterned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
with blatant little splashes of scarlet, black,
magenta, emerald-green.... Futurist, I presume.
How could I ever, ever have dreamt
that life, even in Ballycool Castle, could have
been tolerable with a man who wore ties like
that? I should have left him in a week. No!
I’m sure I should never have been there to leave
him. I couldn’t....</p>

<p>Sydney lighted another cigarette, and the
conversation languished. <em>Nobody</em> spoke.</p>

<p>In the middle of this sickening sag to the talk
I had an inspiration!</p>

<p>I thought, since both these young men sing
and one of them composes, that it would be at
this juncture a bright thought to introduce the
subject of music.</p>

<p>Why did I do it?</p>

<p>It was distinctly what Jack calls “a wash-out.”
For Sydney Vandeleur at once switched
off on to Eleventh Century folk-songs. And
Mr. Waters, asked if he didn’t think they were
too delicious, was “afraid the Eleventh Century
was out of his groove.”</p>

<p>And then Sydney hummed several only
slightly more modern Celtic dirges—one about
“The Sweet Flowers, all gone to Decay!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Waters said he preferred his flowers
<em>fresh</em>; adding bluntly that he loathed all those
miserable minor wails himself, and quite agreed
with that law which Queen Elizabeth passed for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
the Irish bards of her time, sentencing them to
death if they composed songs on any subject
whatsoever except in praise of the Queen’s most
Excellent Majesty.</p>

<p>That brought back some of Sydney’s first
pose. With a pained little smile he turned to
me, then, putting on just the expression of the
bereaved collie in Landseer’s “Shepherd’s Chief
Mourner,” he asked me if I <em>happened</em> to have
kept the MS. of that little thing he’d written
for me to that sonnet—“<cite>Kissing her Hair, I sat
against her Feet</cite>.”</p>

<p>I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my
own wretched hair that he’d always so praised
... there was something about kissing of hair
which <em>he</em> knew nothing of, and that I was only
too thankful to let die a natural death....
Rather shortly, I answered, “Oh, that song—yes;
it’s tucked away in some drawer or other
here, I believe.”</p>

<p>“If it wouldn’t be troubling you too much,
Miss Trant, to lend it to me again? It was
my only copy,” suggested Sydney softly (<i lang="it">con
molto espressione</i>).</p>

<p>“Of course,” said I. “I’ll find it for you
now. Cicely, you might come into my room
and help me to hunt.”</p>

<p>Cicely followed me, leaving those two men
to entertain each other. How they proceeded
to do so I suppose I shall never know!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Cis, how are you getting on?” I
asked her, when the door was closed between
us and them. “Foot’s all right, I see, and you
said you’d gone back to work?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not at Chérisette’s, you know;
I’m working opposite in Bond Street; Madame
Lamaire’s. Mr. Vandeleur got me an introduction
from his married sister, who knows her;
and I’m getting a better salary, and such a much
better time, there. He has been so awfully
kind, Tots!”</p>

<p>“Has he? Have you—been seeing a good
deal of him, then?”</p>

<p>“He’s been here several times, but”—reproachfully—“only
to talk about you!”</p>

<p>“Good of him,” I said.</p>

<p>Cicely looked more reproach. “Well, he
says you’ve taken all the colour out of his life
and left ‘<i>gold tarnished and the grey above the
green</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Drat him! And his colours!” I quoted
Mrs. Skinner vulgarly and vindictively. “He’d
plenty of them left in his tie, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Cecily aloofly and with a
pointed comparison in her face, “that you’ve
scarcely <em>realized</em> Mr. Vandeleur.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? Well, the sort of man who,
when he’s turned down by one girl, must needs
rush and pour it all out into the shell-like ear of
the next——” But I broke off here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>What I suddenly did realize was that, for next
to no reason, I was on the brink of squabbling
ridiculously with my chum.</p>

<p>So I hastily changed the subject to rent-money
and the length of time I should probably
be away, caught up Sydney’s ever-to-be-hated
song, reassured Cicely that I was not going to
be married until after the summer—<em>long</em> after!
and told her I was glad she was getting on so
well.</p>

<p>“Get Mr. Vandeleur, if he wants cheering
up, to take you to ‘<cite>The Keening of Deidre</cite>,’”
said I. “Good-bye!”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>It threatened to be a silent motor-drive
back to Sevenoaks.</p>

<p>Again I felt that I should have to be the one
to take the plunge into conversation.</p>

<p>“Well?” I said. “Didn’t you think Miss
Harradine a very pretty girl?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful hair,” said Mr. Waters, “hasn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lovely.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>I saw that Mr. Waters hadn’t realized what I
suspected: namely, that Sydney was beginning
to find my chum quite sufficiently “lovely” as
a girl, not merely as a confidante for his sorrows
about “another,” who was, as he imagined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
“another’s.” But I was longing to hear some
comment on Sydney.</p>

<p>I should have been left longing, I suppose,
if I hadn’t said straight out, “What <em>did</em> you
think of Mr. Vandeleur?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come! What a question! How can
one tell, after seeing a man for half an hour?
He seemed—clever, and all that,” fenced my
companion. “Of course he’s not the sort of
man <em>I</em> get thrown much with in that sordid,
detestable City of mine, as you call it. What
does he do?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have to ‘do’ anything.”</p>

<p>“Rather lucky for him,” remarked Mr. Waters,
in a tone I didn’t fathom.</p>

<p>I said, “But he does draw and design—and
he writes dramatic criticisms—and he composes.”</p>

<p>“Gifted sort of chap,” said Mr. Waters
smoothly. “I suppose——”</p>

<p>And then stopped.</p>

<p>“You suppose what?” I urged. “No, do
tell me,” as he looked obstinately ahead and shut
his lips into that line. “You <em>must</em>, Billy!”
Then I found myself laughing and colouring a
little with surprise. For the first time I’d used
that absurd name in speaking directly to him.</p>

<p>He turned to me, smiling once more in quite
a friendly way. But it was not to answer my
question. It was to ask another.</p>

<p>“Nancy, you know I shall expect you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
write to me? When you’re at Porth Cariad
with my mother and the girls, I mean....
It’ll look funny if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. For the look of the thing,”
said I, “I’ll write.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to trouble you. You can put a blank
sheet into the envelope, you know, if you like.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that!” I laughed, glad
to be once again on comfortable terms of chatty
friendship. “But—so I can.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you don’t forget to send
<em>something</em>,” said Billy Waters.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>He reminded me of this once again, on Euston
platform. For we—his mother, his sisters, his
official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> and the little dog—left London
at eleven o’clock on the following Saturday
morning.</p>

<p>That evening we were all among the sand-slopes
and the gorse and the soft calling of the
waves at Porth Cariad.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST LETTERS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Hullo, Robert Roberts! Any letters for
us?” sang out Theo.</p>

<p>She had darted out of the cottage, hatless, as
usual, her nose already peeling with sunburn and
her long bare legs covered with midge-bites and
sea-holly scratches down to her white sand-shoes,
to waylay our postman; he’s the son of
Mrs. Roberts, our landlady, a young Welsh giant
who wears that uniform coat for just that five
minutes daily which it takes him to deliver the
mails at Porth Cariad.</p>

<p>“Yes, mam!” he announced. “Picture poss-card
for you—I wonder shall I have it, mam,
when you read it? Blodwen and me is making
a co-leckshon of those. Letter for your mother;
letter an’ <em>big</em> parsal for the strange young lady.”</p>

<p>I—who have not been seen in the place before
this year—am the strange young lady.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” said Theo, bringing the mail
into the kitchen-sitting-room where we’d just
finished breakfast; a room that boasts three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
grandfather clocks and five pairs of china dogs
and a dresser crowded with blue-and-white
plates. “The letter and the ‘parsal’ for Nancy
are both from the Adored One!”</p>

<p>Meaning her brother.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you’ll now have to fly off
somewhere to read your love-letter all by yourself.”</p>

<p>“Of course I must,” I laughed.</p>

<p>For it’s rather amusing in the face of all this
to think that, except for one sentimental scrap
from Sydney, I’ve never had a love-letter to read
in all my life!</p>

<p class="tb">This duty-document of my official <i lang="fr">fiancé’s</i>
I’ve taken out on to the sand-hills; there’s a
dip under the crest of one of them where I can
curl up in comfort out of the wind, facing the
view across the bay, with that pale lilac silhouette
of the Carnarvonshire hills across the water.</p>

<p>How funny it seems to unfold a letter bearing
the familiar heading of the Near Oriental Shipping
Company’s offices! But this one, actually,
is not type-written, and signed by a “William
Waters, per pro.,” and a scrawled “A. A.”
of Mr. Alexander’s.</p>

<p>William Waters has written in his own hand;
not a particularly good one, either. Several
sheets of it? Was it such an unusually slack day
at the office, then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

wonder what you think of Porth Cariad.
I do hope you won’t be bored to extinction

pier-concerts and shops and things? Do
you think you can manage to make yourself
at all happy without them?</p>

<p>“How do you like the bathing in that

night. I took a man who lives near to share
my solitary meal there, and to have a game

glad to see me, will you? as Theo—but
I put that before.</p>

<p>“Just before I went out to lunch a very
rum thing happened: at least, I thought
it was rum until I found out what it was.
I was opening the door of my room when I
heard, in the passage, <em>your voice</em>, Nancy!
Yes, your voice, with that little dare-devil
tone you put on sometimes, saying these
extraordinary words: ‘<i>I think it’s to the
Savoy that I’m going out with Mr. Waters
to-day</i>!’</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think what on earth was the
meaning of it, with you miles away in
Anglesey.”</p>

</div>

<p>(But already I smiled, seeing what was
coming!)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I wondered what could have brought
you back, or if I’d got an hallucination—can
you hear hallucinations?—and I bolted
out into the passage, nearly knocking over
two of the typists who were coming down it.</p>

<p>“Miss Smith (that’s the one whose affections
are otherwise engaged, isn’t it?) fled
like a hare; but that tall, dark Miss Robinson
stood her ground, only moving aside a
little for me to pass. I stopped and asked
her straight out, ‘Was it you who were
speaking a moment ago?’</p>

<p>“She said ‘Yes’—all meekness at once.
‘Mimicking hussy’ I thought—for it really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
had been exactly the way I’ve heard you
speak, you know, sometimes. It was all
I could do to keep from laughing outright,
but I just said ‘Well, I am writing to Miss
Trant to-day; can I give her any message
from you?’</p>

<p>“And she said (in that ‘mim’ voice,
which I’m blest if I shall ever feel able to
believe in again!) ‘Will you please give
her my love, Mr. Waters?’</p>

<p>“So with love from Miss Robinson, I
remain,</p>

<p class="center">“Your</p>

</div>

<p>(What’s this? “Your” Billy? It can’t be.
Oh, no. It’s his disgraceful handwriting. It’s
the “r” being scrawled into the “s” like that.
“Yours, Billy,” is how it really reads. How
stupid of me not to see that at once! Then
there’s a bit across the top.)</p>

will write at once; I’ll do it out here, in pencil

<span class="smaller">THE WOODEN WOMAN</span></h2>

</div>

<p>If a girl were the least bit inclined to fall
in love with Billy Waters—and I see now
that some girls might be; though not, of course,
any girl of my type, capable of this kind of frank
friendship that puts anything else out of the question!—well,
if she were, she’d find it much easier
to complete the process here at Porth Cariad
than anywhere else that I can imagine him.</p>

<p>Some men—generally the nicest—are so much
more <em>themselves</em> in the depths of the country.
He is.</p>

<p>I noticed that the very first evening he
arrived here, when I went down to meet him—to
keep up appearances before his family—at
this tiny station on the branch line. Before
the train stopped I saw his head and shoulders
blocking up the open window of his compartment
in his hurry to arrive. Catching sight of
me on the platform, he took the pipe from
between his strong white teeth and flourished
it over his head in greeting—his face one broad
smile because his holiday had begun; then the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
train slowed down; he was out of the carriage
door and taking a running stride towards me.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Nancy!” he said, and grasped my
hands. “You came? I wondered if you
would. It’s very—appropriate of you. How
are you? You look very fit. A sun-bonnet,
eh?”—It was a haymaker’s cotton one, that
I’d bought for a shilling and a ha’penny at the
post office, and rather becoming—“I’ve never
seen you in a pink sun-bonnet before.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be likely to in Leadenhall
Street,” I retorted. “How’s the dear office?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know or care. I’m here to forget
it,” he said gaily as we left the station for the
road between the sand-hills. “I think I shall
take to wearing a sun-bonnet myself!”</p>

<p class="tb">But what he wears here is just a soft white
shirt with a turn-down collar and a pair of loose
grey flannel bags belted at the waist; no hat at
all—his hair has got to look as if it must be
permanently rumpled; no one from the office
would recognize him! Even his eyes seem a
different colour; so much warmer and bluer
for the deepening of his tan. He drops a year
a day from his age, too. When one sees him
striding about these sandy lanes, or terrifying his
mother by those efforts to walk on his hands
in six foot of water in the bay, or when he’s
pretending to jabber back Welsh to Mrs. Roberts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
and Blodwen, who openly adore him—yes, I
can imagine quite a number of people finding
him positively attractive here in the country.</p>

<p>In the country, too, as I’ve always heard,
it’s so much easier to fall in love than it is in town.
Town, with its rush and racket and roar, seems
to insist that the things that really matter
are getting on and making money—or even the
bare living for which half these grimy crowds
are struggling and toiling! But the country!—<em>that</em>
has a way of suggesting itself as a series
of lovely backgrounds for a grouping of Two,
and of coaxing home the idea that all that
matters is Love. To a falling-in-love kind of
person the country here would seem as bad
as Hamlet for being “<i>so full of quotations</i>” from
every poet who ever wrote about trysts, and
gathering rosebuds, and loves in valleys, and
foolish, pretty nonsense of that sort. <em>They’d</em>
be reminded of it by every dance of a pair of
blue butterflies over the dunes; every spread
of the rosy arms of sea-anemones in the pool
towards the incoming wave; and as for these
other waves of scented gold that are poured
over all the waste ground hereabouts——</p>

<p>“It’s a blessing there’s such a lot of it out
just now!” as Theo remarked this morning
at breakfast. “I suppose engaged people <em>would</em>
want to be where there was plenty of gorse!”</p>

<p>Whereat her brother and I exchanged glances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
across the table, of amused intelligence. For
it’s all very well for this child to think she can
“chip” us with that old tag about kissing and
the gorse in bloom. We’ve only got to remember
how little she suspects that the only kiss between
us is that “duty good night” one of Uncle
Albert’s visit, and the laugh is all on our side!</p>

<p class="tb">“You needn’t laugh, Billy,” Theo added.
“You know you’re really frightfully cross because
you won’t be able to get Nancy all to yourself
this afternoon, with these people coming!”</p>

<p>It was the first I’d heard of any visitors, for
I’d come down rather late that morning. I
hadn’t slept as well as I usually do. Outside
the window of my little sloping-ceilinged cottage
bedroom the water, at high tide, had seemed
to make rather more noise than its usual soft
lap-lapping against the rocks. And then the
moon, rising like a big round primrose-coloured
Chinese lantern in the star-sprinkled purple
sky over the Rivals on the other side of the
Menai Straits, had poured a flood of white
radiance straight upon my bed, and I hadn’t
bothered to get up and pull down the yellow
linen blind to shut it out. I had wanted to
feel the sea-scented night-breeze across my face.
So I had lain there, tossing a little between the
snowy rough country sheets, watching the
square of light creeping inch by inch up the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
and thinking idly of all sorts of irrelevant
things....</p>

<p>Of Cicely in Marconi Mansions....</p>

<p>Of “Smithie” at the office, and her boy.
They didn’t prove much truth in the theory
that people fall more deeply in love in the
country. I saw again that crossing at the
Bank, with the big motor-buses skidding across
the muddy road like beginners on skates; and
there, in the middle of the fog and the petrol-reek
and the jostling luncheon-hour crowds,
those two anæmic, City-fied young faces shone as
radiantly as if the lovers walked the loneliest
Eden that ever was....</p>

<p>Of a school-friend of my own, now very
happily married, who had said to me, long ago:
“An engagement, Monica, is such a <em>skimpy</em>
time! It’s made up of nothing but good-byes
and good nights to the person you most
want to be always with!”</p>

<p>And of the difference between that sort of
engagement and the “arrangement” between
myself and Billy Waters, which has converted
itself into such an entirely satisfactory and
amusing friendship....</p>

<p>The result was that I’d dropped off to sleep
again after Blodwen’s bang on my bedroom door,
and that I’d been the last down at breakfast.</p>

<p>“Who’s this that’s coming, Billy?” I asked.
“Your Uncle Albert again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>“No, thank—I mean, no, not him,” said Billy.
“Some French people you haven’t met yet.
They’re touring North Wales in their car. He’s
a man I’ve had a good deal to do with in
business.”</p>

<p>“And <em>she</em>——” began Theo, stopping uncharacteristically
short as her brother went
on, tapping a letter he held.</p>

<p>“I’ve just heard from him that they’re
in Holyhead now, and coming over here to look
us up this afternoon. So that puts a stopper
on our plan of painting that figure-head for
Mrs. Roberts after lunch. We’ll have to see
if we can get it done this morning instead. Good
thing I got that paint last night at the wheelwright’s.
Are you on, Nancy? Then, if you’re
ready, we’ll start now, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Blanche and I don’t think we’ll come,
thank you,” said Theodora punctiliously.</p>

<p>“What, not until you’re asked?” laughed
her brother, rummaging for the paint-pots
under the southernwood bush at the cottage
door. He gave me one pot and the brushes
to carry, taking the other two himself. “Well,
good-bye, all!”</p>

<p>“Come back, then, Cariad!” called Blanche,
but the little white dog frisked unheedingly
in circles ahead of us, across the shingle at the
edge of the cove, over a couple of sand-hills,
then up the steps cut in the turf of the cliff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
where the Roberts have set up a flagstaff and
the wooden woman.</p>

<p class="tb">She’d been the figure-head of the <i>Gwladys
Pritchard</i>, Mrs. Roberts had told us, which
had been wrecked in the bay below, many years
ago; the name and the face alike having been
copied from the real girl who was “cariad”
to the owner of the vessel.</p>

<p>“She must have been pretty,” I thought,
the first time I climbed the cliff.</p>

<p>For many coats of paint, roughly applied,
could not spoil or disguise the setting of the
carved girl’s eyes, nor the tender oval of the
up-tilted chin, nor the lines of the neck flowing
down into the sloping shoulders and the figure
held up in an unmodern curve above the corset
of the Sixties, which must have set the fashion
of Miss Pritchard’s dress. She wore a little
jacket with basques and epaulettes and shoulder-seams
set far down the sleeves; and a tiny pork-pie
hat, trimmed with a wing, was perched upon
her hair, which had been last painted yellow as
the gorse that grew in hummocks all around her.
The jacket had been white, with trimmings of
emerald green; the same green, too, plastered
the hat and the wooden nosegay which she held
up against her breast. Yet, for all this crude
green-and-white, for all the untaught modelling
of it, there was a vitality about this graven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
image which I’d never seen in any statue. Was
it because it had once been part of that live
thing, a ship?</p>

<p>I could picture that image of a slender girl,
leaning breast forward again from the prow of
her lover’s vessel as she heaved and dipped like
a gull on the waves; scanning horizons, joyously
riding the gale, and free to sea and sky!</p>

<p>Rooted in turf, the immobility of cliff and
rock was now her prison, while the gulls still
screamed and wheeled above her....</p>

<p>And the real Gwladys?</p>

<p>“Did she go down with the ship?” I’d
asked Mrs. Roberts.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, mam. There wasn’t one
drowned on the <i>Gwladys Pritchard</i>,” Mrs.
Roberts had assured us. “That Miss Pritchard
she was marry to my cousin, Captain Lloyd,
since—dear me, I don’t know when. They
keepin’ a public-house in Bluemaris now. Ô! she
<em>is</em> gone stout, too!”</p>

<p>“It would have been <em>prettier</em> if she’d been
drowned,” Blanche had said softly.</p>

<p>“Mam?” Mrs. Roberts had said.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Waters had finished the story by
telling us gently, “Anyhow, the Lloyds have
three of the <em>sweetest</em> little grandchildren;
I’ve seen them!”</p>

<p>Evidently <em>she</em> had thought that for either
woman or ship to be safe in harbour like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
was better than any more picturesque finale....
Well! I don’t know....</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>We reached the flagstaff, and set down
our pots of paint among the buffets of gorse
that had sprays of purple ling and blue scabious
growing through and making a bouquet of each.</p>

<p>Billy’s shirt-sleeves are always rolled up to the
elbow; the sleeves of my white cotton frock
are three-quarter length; so we were both
equipped for work, though I’d refused the offer
of Mrs. Roberts’ sackcloth apron. It was <em>too</em>
coal-y and butter-y and paraffiny and scented
with hen! But here the heady warm fragrance
of the gorse almost drowned the smell of our
paints.</p>

<p>“Scarlet, and black, and white? Scarlet
for her hat and jacket, eh?” suggested Billy.
“And how are we going to paint her hands and
face? What colour’s flesh?”</p>

<p>“Some people say it’s just the colour of honeysuckle,”
I answered absently. I can’t be perfectly
certain that he <em>did</em> retort so sharply,
below his breath, “<em>Does</em> he, indeed!” or that
the name of Sydney Vandeleur had been threatening
to crop up once more between us. Still,
I was glad of the wide pink shelter of my sun-bonnet
as I added, in a matter-of-fact way,
“You <em>could</em> get a sort of flesh-tint by mixing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
little of the red with the white paint, but I
don’t think I should. Suppose we leave the
face and hands creamy-white as they are?”</p>

<p>“Very well; and her lips red, and the jacket
and that toque affair, with more dabs of scarlet
for the flowers in her bunch,” he said, kneeling
on the sun-warmed turf on the other side of the
figure from me, “with a black wing in her hat.”</p>

<p>“And her hair left as it is, too,” said I.</p>

<p>“No, no! I got this on purpose for her
hair,” he said, and drew a full brushful of tar-black
paint across the carven and crinkly locks
in front, “she must be a brunette, this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and Mrs. Roberts will be so annoyed to
see her without her beautiful golden chignon,”
I protested, working away with the scarlet paint
at the back of the jacket, “she’ll think she’s
quite spoilt.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; looks much better like this,”
he declared. “A black-haired woman looks
so much more <em>alive</em> than the others. Like red
wine, dark grapes, crimson roses ... fairer
colours are insipid, washed-out-looking!”</p>

<p>“No woman thinks so,” said I. “You never
hear of a blonde tinting herself dark. It’s always
the other way about!”</p>

<p>“I know <em>one</em> girl who wouldn’t change,”
he argued, glancing over the shoulder of the
wooden woman at the border of dark hair between
my bonnet and my face. “You needn’t pretend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
you would, miss! Now what are you smiling
at?”</p>

<p>“Only something,” I said, “that I’d just
remembered.”</p>

<p>“Yes? (You’re an unexpected sex, aren’t
you?) Well, what was this?”</p>

<p>“Only—look out, Billy, you’ll let that black
drop run down the side of her face—only something
a girl I know said about fair men being
like weak tea!”</p>

<p>“Meaning to say, I suppose, that she didn’t
think much of <em>your</em> taste in <i lang="fr">fiancés</i>?” suggested
Billy Waters, with a mischievous laugh. I
laughed too. And for the several score of times
since we have been here together, I thought
to myself what a delightful and unusual and
thoroughly satisfactory arrangement this friendship
of ours had turned out to be.</p>

<p>I never dreamed that at that very moment
<em>the life of that friendship had about five more
minutes to run</em>.</p>

<p>“There!” said Billy, picking himself up and
taking a few steps back from the figure, to survey
it, with his fair head on one side. “You
can’t say it isn’t an improvement. What would
your friend say to that coloured hair?”</p>

<p>“Strong tea,” I suggested flippantly. “Tea
that’s stood too long!”</p>

<p>“You aren’t looking at it. Come over here
and see!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>I straightened myself and went and stood
beside him.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Nancy, the lady’s got
rather a look of <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>And actually something in the contrast of
the glistening black locks against the creamy-pale
face with the now scarlet-tinted lips might
have been vaguely characteristic of what, night
and morning, I see in my own mirror.</p>

<p>“Well, but I hope <em>I</em> don’t look as if I ‘made
up’ my mouth!”</p>

<p>“Why, you <em>don’t</em> make it up, do you?”</p>

<p>“Of <em>course</em> not,” said I. And then I turned
from looking at the painted figure to the
other deeper, tenderer colour of the sea washing
a strip of sand below the cliff.</p>

<p>“Oh, it <em>is</em> lovely here,” I sighed, revelling in
the beauty of that and the sky. “Did you ever
<em>see</em> anything so blue as it is to-day?”</p>

<p>“Or so golden?” added Billy, nodding towards
the hassocks of gorse in full bloom. “I’ve never
seen it like this before. D’you know that there’s
a Welsh proverb that calls this county ‘the land
of thriftless gold’? Rather pretty, isn’t it?
It must have been wonderful here in the spring;
this is the second crop, you know. A man I know
once told me that it was like falling in love.”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean?” I asked, as he stopped.
“Aren’t you going to paint the wing in her hat
while you’ve that brush full of black paint?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Presently.—Oh, yes, about that gorse. He
said the first blooming was more showy—more
fuss made over it—first love, you know, and all
that; but that it was nothing like as sweet as
the later time. Should you agree with him,
d’you think?”</p>

<p>“How <em>should</em> I know?” I retorted rather
flippantly, to hide my intense surprise that
Billy should possess—let alone quote!—a friend
who sounded so utterly unlike himself. “You
might know me well enough by this time to see
I’m not that sort of girl!”</p>

<p>“Which sort of girl? The kind who doesn’t
fall in love a second time?”</p>

<p>“The kind who doesn’t fall in love at all,”
I said decidedly. “Anyhow, I find the second
blooming of the gorse, without any metaphors,
quite beautiful enough against that dragonfly-blue
bit of Bay!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! You’re fond of the effect of
flowering plants against the blue sea, as I think
you mentioned, the evening my uncle dined at
The Lawn,” said Billy, teasingly and unexpectedly.
“Only, didn’t you specify oleanders
and myrtles and the Riviera——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! I never thought you’d do that,”
I interrupted him with real reproach. “No; I
<em>never</em> thought you’d be so mean as to remind me,
ever again, of that ghastly evening! I didn’t!”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. He stared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
down at me. I wouldn’t look at him. I turned
to look at a brown velvet bee that was buzzing
some flattery or other into the golden ear of a
gorse-blossom near by. Then I heard him say
slowly:</p>

<p>“‘Ghastly,’ you call it?”</p>

<p>“Well—! Of <em>course</em>!”</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, still more slowly. “You
mean that it still rankles. You haven’t forgotten....
You resent that still, in spite of
agreeing to be friends ... in spite of letting
one suppose that—well! that it <em>wasn’t</em> so sickeningly
hard for you now, after all. You <em>do</em>
bear a grudge then, still. You mean—” It
came out, the last thing I ever expected to hear
him mention!—“that about that kiss!”</p>

<p>“That?” I retorted quickly, and with my
airiest laugh, for this seemed the only way in
which to face the paralysingly embarrassing point
he’d seen fit to raise again. “Oh, that! I
never gave it a thought, Billy! I quite understood!
Besides, you couldn’t possibly call that
private-theatricals sort of peck a <em>kiss</em>, exactly!”</p>

<p>“No,” he returned, as quickly. “You
couldn’t, could you?”</p>

<p>He took a step towards me, then caught me
to him by the shoulders, and for a second I
thought he was going to gratify the longing
which I’d seen in his eyes any time during that
first week of my stay at The Lawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>I thought he was going to shake me.</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>In quicker time than it can be told, his hands
had flown from my shoulders to the pink strings
of my sun-bonnet; he’d untied them and tossed
the bonnet on to the nearest hassock of a gorse-bush.
He put both brown hands under my chin
and turned my face up to his. Before I could
so much as gasp, he swooped down and kissed
me, muttering, “But what could you call this—and
this—and this?” Three times—greedily—on
the mouth.</p>

<p class="tb">For a second I had to clutch at his shoulder
to steady myself; for sea and cliff and gorse
seemed wheeling round me in swirls of blue and
green and gold.</p>

<p>Then I wrenched myself away and faced him—without
seeing too distinctly what was in front
of my eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything to me,” I heard myself
tell him, in a voice that sounded unnaturally
quiet and calm. “This—this can’t be forgiven.
Don’t ask.”</p>

<p>I heard him begin to say something about:
“Do you think I am made of——”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak to me again, please,” I said, still
in that unnaturally quiet voice. “Not again.”</p>

<p>I snatched up my sun-bonnet from the gorse-bush,
rammed it down over my hair, and tied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the strings so tightly beneath my chin that they
nearly throttled me. Then I turned, saying,
“I forbid you to follow me,” and left him standing
there between cliff and sky, beside the
wooden woman.</p>

<p>I walked on until I thought I was out of his
sight, then I ran; ran blindly across the cove
and up the sandy path to the cottages.</p>

<p>On the doorstep of the larger one Theo was
sitting, emptying her white canvas shoes of
sand on to the cobbles of the garden path.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Nancy! Do you know that Cariad
was so bored with you that he ran home?” she
said. “What have you done with Billy the
Beloved? Is he——”</p>

<p>“Let me pass, please,” I said quietly, and
walked swiftly into the house. The kitchen
door was open and Mrs. Roberts was laying
the table for the mid-day meal. She began,
“Was you finiss paint the——” but I couldn’t
stop to speak to her. I ran up the rickety
wooden stairs to my bedroom. There isn’t
a lock on the door; I looked. So I just latched
it, and went and sat down on my bed, with
its patchwork quilt of faded pinks and mauves.
I began tracing with my fingers the pattern
made by the hexagonal patches of purple. I
don’t think I thought of anything at all.</p>

<p>And I don’t know how long I’d been sitting
there before I heard light steps on the staircase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
and a tap at the door. I raised my voice a
little.</p>

<p>“Don’t come in.”</p>

<p>“Nancy,”—it was Blanche—“dinner’s ready!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any dinner. I am not coming
down.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—What’s the matter, dear?”—with
quick concern. “Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“No! I’m not ill!”</p>

<p>“Have you got a headache?”</p>

<p>“No! I haven’t got a headache. Only please
go away. I don’t want to see anybody.”</p>

<p>I heard her go softly downstairs again—then the
kitchen door opening, and a murmur of voices.</p>

<p>His voice.</p>

<p class="tb">Ah! that brought my anger surging over me
at last like a great wave. I sat bolt upright, with
a crumple of the quilt clutched in each hand.</p>

<p>How dared he! How <em>dared</em> he!</p>

<p>Taking odious advantage of a situation!
<em>This</em> was not what I agreed to when I said I
would be nominally engaged to him.</p>

<p><em>This</em> was not unavoidable, like that last time.</p>

<p>Oh! He needn’t have pointed out to me
the difference between that time and this! I’d
<em>thought</em> I was angry then. My anger now was
as different a thing as the difference between
those two sorts of kisses.</p>

<p><em>Oh!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p><em>He’s</em> broken the contract—he knows that it
was tacitly understood that there should be
nothing of this—In fact, it wasn’t so much as
thought of—<em>ever</em>.</p>

<p><em>Right</em> on my mouth!...</p>

<p>Well, I don’t owe him anything after this.
I shan’t speak to him again. I shall have
nothing more to do with him. He’s a right to
my name as his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, he can keep that—at
a distance! My name—nothing else. I
shan’t go on staying with his people after this!
Let him make what excuse he chooses to his
mother about that. Let him explain it away as
he likes. I shan’t help him!</p>

<p>If it were to save his life, I’d never lift a finger
to help him again!</p>

<p>I shall go away at once....</p>

<p>How could he! Whether it was a vulgar
attempt at flirtation, or simply that he was
riled and meant to be rude to me in the most
brutal manner he could think of—I don’t care
which it was!</p>

<p>What had I said—done—looked—that he
should imagine he might?</p>

<p>After this, he might even say I’d encouraged
him!</p>

<p>Hateful, <em>hateful</em>!</p>

<p>Well, I shall go away....</p>

<p>Brute!</p>

<p>To-morrow, I shall <em>go</em>!</p>

<span class="smaller">“MANY WATERS——”</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Well! Anyhow there’s no sense in
sitting up in my room brooding over
this thing, on a heavenly afternoon like this and
all.</p>

<p>I’m not going to miss it all just to please <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>And if I am leaving everything—sea and sunshine
and mountains—to-morrow, I may as well
take in as much of them as I can to-day. Besides,
I suppose I shall have to go down some
time.</p>

<p>There are these people—whoever they are—expected
this afternoon. Obviously I shall have
to be at tea to meet them? I shouldn’t in the
least mind letting <em>him</em> down by remaining
invisible until I’m all packed up and ready for
the little local train that must take me up to
Holyhead to meet the Euston mail. But there
is his mother to consider—she has been so sweet
to me from the beginning. What I can’t understand
about her is how she ever managed to have
such a son? There must have been something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
odd and horrid about the father; and he must
take after him. The <em>girls</em> are all right.</p>

<p>There they are, going out now; down the
sandy path to the station; Theo bare-legged
and bare-headed as usual, swinging a basket;
off to buy jam, I expect, for the visitors’ tea;
Blanche carrying letters. I heard his step on
the cobbles ten minutes ago, and Mrs. Waters
always rests in her room until three o’clock.
The coast’s quite clear, then. Why shouldn’t
I go out and have my bathe? I missed it this
morning—thanks to all <em>that</em>! Perhaps the cool
green waves of the Bay will help me to feel as if
I’d washed a little of that memory away from
me. Already it seems years since my last bathe;
only yesterday morning! When the girls and I
ran down together, to find him already in,
practising walking under the water; and he’d
called out “I say! Isn’t it topping to be
alive on a day like this?” as he emerged, head
up once more, dripping and glowing in his
indigo-blue sheath, his hair sleek once more
with the wet, his arms and shoulders as smooth
and pinky-white as any of ours, but making ours
look curiously slender and delicate.</p>

<p>Years ago! Everything had been so different!
I’d thought <em>he</em> was so different.</p>

<p>Well! This will be my last bathe for the
summer, so I may as well enjoy it, all to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>I undressed quickly, slipped into my black
woven silk club costume, and twisted round my
head the long orange silk scarf that keeps my
hair from getting too wet. I simply won’t take
to one of those sponge-bag-like rubber caps that
some girls still wear for bathing. They’re too
unsightly for anything—and one doesn’t exactly
want to look a blot on the seascape, even if there
doesn’t happen to be anyone else bathing, to
see one....</p>

<p>As it happened, I found, to my great annoyance,
that there was someone else already in the
little cove next to the cottages that it was
Theo’s idea to christen “The Bay of <em>Many
Waters</em>.” There was a smooth head, some
distance out, dark against the afternoon glitter;
a steady stroke that I knew.</p>

<p><em>Oh!</em></p>

<p>So he’d come out first!</p>

<p>Well, that meant that I couldn’t have my
bathe here after all—just like him!... Fresh
rage against him surged up in me as I caught up
the white wrap of Turkey-towelling that I had
thrown down upon a seaweedy rock with my
string-soled shoes. I’d leave him to it. Perhaps
I could get a dip in the next bay under that
cliff where the wooden woman leaned forward
to her watch?</p>

<p>But, even as I turned to slip away, I
heard a sound from across the water that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
seemed to make my heart, for a second, stop its
beating.</p>

<p>It was a choking shout for help.</p>

<p>“Nancy!—Here!—Here!”</p>

<p>Then that dark head disappeared under the
water.</p>

<p>It couldn’t possibly have been for as long as
it <em>seemed</em>. No!</p>

<p>People can’t hold their breath for as long.
Then it was up again. The swimmer had flung
himself on his back and was floating. And I—without
actually realizing what I had been
doing, I must have cast off my wrap again, have
splashed through the creamy surf of the first
waves into the smoother jade-green depths
beyond, for I found myself swimming, striking
out, out—from the shore....</p>

<p>Still I didn’t know how I’d started—or why.
Except that here was a human being in trouble
whom, somehow or other, I had to help. I
didn’t think about who it was. It wasn’t
because of that broken shout of “<em>Nancy!</em>”
I’m sure. No; I am sure that, just then, no
thought of saving Still Waters was in my mind.
It was just another human being who had called
to me; and towards whom I swam so desperately,
making, in my hurry, such a splashing over each
stroke that it seemed to me endless before I
came up to where he floated on his back.</p>

<p>Automatically I remembered something our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
swimming-instructor had drilled into us at
school. I found myself telling myself that it
was dangerous—dangerous to get within reach
of a drowning person’s hands. They’d grip you,
and you’d both go under.</p>

<p>“Keep behind him,” I was telling myself.
“Keep behind him!”</p>

<p>But there was no need for me to trouble about
avoiding his clutch. When he spoke, I realized
that he, in his danger, was keeping his head
far better than I was. He was calm.</p>

<p>“Cramp,” I heard him say, “in my left
leg. You’ll have to tow me. Can you swim
on your back?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Whether I could or not, I supposed, I should
have to.</p>

<p>So in turn I flung myself on my back, and
caught hold of him under those hard, strong-feeling
arms of his.</p>

<p>Then began the struggle back to shore.</p>

<p>The tide was setting in, thank heaven! and
as long as we were in the deep waters it was
not so hard. Presently we came to where the
waves began to break. The wind was blowing
off the shore, blowing the surfy crests of the
waves backwards as a girl’s hair is blown across
her face ... and presently I was half blinded
by the spray that dashed over my head, into my
eyes and mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>I choked, panted....</p>

<p>“Rest a minute,” said a voice close to me.
“No hurry. The tide will take us both in.” ...</p>

<p>But, getting my breath, I struggled on again,
yard by yard. Again I got a mouthful;
spluttered, coughed.</p>

<p>“All right—all right—take it easy!” the voice
was saying.</p>

<p>I simply couldn’t pay any attention to that—I
was labouring with all my strength for both—for
myself and this log in the water that I must—<em>must</em>
get ashore. I was startled when he gave
a sudden powerful jerk of his shoulders that
altered our course.</p>

<p>“You’ll have us on to the reef,” he said.
“I’ll steer—don’t work so hard—”</p>

<p>I heard myself gasping.</p>

<p>—“don’t get flurried, Nancy!”</p>

<p>“Nancy!” Yes! Then I did realize who
it was that I was tugging along with me for dear
life. His life was in my hands—mine, when
I’d felt ready to murder him an hour ago. I’d
had to save it.... “Serve him right,” I
thought wildly, as I struggled along. “Oh,
serve him right! I’ll show him—I’ll teach him
to kiss me again.”</p>

<p>Indeed, I’m not sure that I wasn’t muttering
this aloud to myself in the water. Anyhow,
voices seemed buzzing in my ears—one was his
own as I’d heard it yesterday—“I say! Isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
it topping to be alive? Isn’t it topping to be
alive?”</p>

<p>And then it seemed to come to the very last
effort I could make. “<em>Ah!</em>” I heard myself
groan.</p>

<p>The next thing of which I was conscious
came with a shock of surprise. It was the soft
jolt of my shoulders against sand.</p>

<p>We were aground!</p>

<p>For a minute or so I must have been swimming
furiously in my depth, without even feeling the
growing warmth of the shallows about me.</p>

<p>I let go my wild, unneeded clutch of his arms,
staggered to my feet, waded in, then dropped
again, face downwards and panting, on to the
beach, a few yards below the tide-mark of crisp,
black seaweed, straws, and broken shell.</p>

<p>It was over—we were safe. And now—what?</p>

<p>I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Anyhow, for a moment I lay there unable to
rise or speak. I threw my arm across my eyes.
Then I found that he’d dragged himself up
beside me. He was leaning over me; saying
something I was too dazed to catch.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t want him
to say anything. He needn’t suppose I’d intended
to save his life. He needn’t think this
absurd crisis had made any difference. There
was still this morning between us. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
always would be. This made no difference.
None! None at all!</p>

<p>I got up again, hearing my teeth chatter
a little. I turned to the rock where I’d thrown
down my peignoir, and as I did so, I heard him
behind me raise his voice a little:</p>

<p>“I say! I can’t, you know!—You’ll have to
help me up to the cottages, I’m afraid—”</p>

<p>I glanced down at him; he was sitting up,
his face a little white under the tan, but quiet
and expressionless. And as I looked at him,
sitting there backed by the empty, sunlit cove
and the cliff with the figure-head and flagstaff
small as toys in the distance, I passed through
the one second’s most extraordinary experience
of my life.</p>

<p>Was it a waking-dream, or what? The result
of shock and over-exertion, like those buzzing
voices, just before, among the waves? For
of all the mad, impossible fancies to dash into
one’s mind—before one’s eyes, even!—this was
the maddest.</p>

<p>This was what happened in that second’s
space:</p>

<p><i>Vividly there flashed before me a picture of my
own Self just as I was then, in my black silk maillot
with my wet black hair streaming down my neck;
for I’d lost my scarf, it floated like a torn-off
strand of orange-coloured seaweed on the waves.
I saw it there.... And I saw that mind-picture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
of myself fling herself down on her knees beside him
again—fling herself into his arms, cold from the
sea-water and dripping and hard; saw her bury
her face against his throat; heard, more clearly
than in a dream, her gasping sob of, “Billy!
You were drowning! I might have lost you!”</i></p>

<p>Then—flick! the picture vanished, and I was
drawing my wrap about me composedly enough
as I replied to him coldly, “I will help you up—on
one condition. That you don’t speak
to me.”</p>

<p>He said quietly, “You prefer that?”</p>

<p>“Only on that condition,” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he rose slowly to his feet, trying
them one after the other in the sand. “Only—I’m
afraid I shall have to lean on you a bit—not
hard.”</p>

<p>So, after I’d helped him on with his own wrap,
I stood for him to put his arm about my shoulders.
I don’t know if he leaned hard or no.
Slowly and in silence, we walked up so from the
shore to the cottages. Just before we got to
the sandy path in front, his arm dropped, and he
smothered an exclamation:</p>

<p>“Hul-<em>lo</em>!”</p>

<p>For, tilted up between the deep ruts made by
Mr. Roberts’ cart in the sand in front of the
cottage gardens, we caught sight of a motor-car;
a gaudy, cherry-coloured affair, all
ablaze with sunlit brass. The visitors. They’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
come, then. I’d forgotten <em>them</em>. They were
in my cottage at tea, I discovered, after he had
turned quickly in at the little gate of the cottage
he shares with Blanche; from behind the door
of the kitchen sitting-room of our larger one I
heard a babble of talk and much laughter. Must
I face it? With this dreadful day behind me?
Slowly I mounted the wooden stairs to my
room and began to dress. I was, all of a sudden,
deadly tired; why, I felt only half awake;
what I would have liked would have been to
fling myself down on that patchwork-quilted
bed and sleep the time away until I was to leave
Porth Cariad for ever.</p>

<p>That this must needs have happened this
afternoon, to add to the conglomeration of
things between him and me that I longed to
forget! After the way he behaved this
morning!</p>

<p>(Ah, Billy, why did you? We were such
chums!) <em>Caddish</em> of him! To think that he
<em>might</em>—that I could be treated so!</p>

<p>That fact remained—and all the waves in the
Bay of Many Waters hadn’t washed any of its
bitterness away. As for that mad, mad fancy of
mine afterwards on the beach—well! it must
have been something like the way people declare
that the whole of a drowning person’s past life
rises before them in the moment of peril. Only,
of course, those would be pictures of things that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
had happened—not the reverse of anything
that ever, ever <em>could</em> happen!</p>

<p>One thing—I’d never let him thank me for
the outwardly magnanimous act into which
I’d been just forced, and which had left me too
utterly exhausted even to rage over it as I might.
My arms felt almost too limp to raise to my
head as I wrung my streaming hair into a towel
and pinned it, still wet, firmly about my head.
It took me minutes to put on each garment.
Meantime those minutes were ebbing away,
and these people downstairs were being kept
waiting, expecting to see his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> at
the tea-table. And if I felt I couldn’t stay
up here as I longed to do, it wasn’t on his account.
It wasn’t the girl he’d engaged—and
insulted so!—it was his mother’s guest who
confronted in the wavy looking-glass her very
washed-out appearance, her dark, ringed eyes
and damp hair plastered down to keep it from
dripping on to the first clean blouse that had
come to hand.</p>

<p>Certainly I looked very little credit to him!</p>

<p>With a shrug I turned away and went downstairs.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>The warm kitchen seemed full of people and
their voices, and of a mingled scent of brewing
tea and warm butter and—could it be a whiff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
of perfume: <i lang="fr">trèfle</i>? The tea-table was crowded
with Mrs. Roberts’ gayest crockery, with her
largest black teapot, with mounds of yellow
light-cakes and clusters of brown eggs and great
slabs of Welsh farmhouse bread-and-butter.
In the middle a glass jug held a bouquet of
heather and honeysuckle and blue scabious.
There was a dish of damson jam, and a very
golden, “shoppy” cake.</p>

<p>At the head of the table, Mrs. Waters was
entertaining a stout, sallow gentleman with a
black moustache and a plaid tie, who was talking
French very fast and with a good deal of gesture.
Blanche, elbows on the table, was leaning
eagerly across it to talk; opposite to her were
her brother, looking much as usual again, I saw,
and Theodora in a state of flushed animation,
from whom, in the general babble, I caught
something that sounded like “tell Billy’s sweetheart—”
and between Theodora and him there
sat, leaning back in her chair and laughing gaily,
a young girl in a wonderfully-cut and simple
get-up of flame-yellow and white and cream,
with a swirl of feathery yellow about her midnight
black hair; one of the prettiest girls I’d ever seen
in my life. Ah! it was she who’d brought in
that whiff of clover-scent?</p>

<p>She was laughing up into his face.</p>

<p>And she was calling my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> “Billy.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THAT GIRL</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There was a scraping of wooden chair-legs
on the tiled kitchen floor as I came in,
and the men rose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waters introduced “Our friend Monsieur
Charrier and his daughter”—and the stout
gentleman, who wore pale-hued boots shaped
like the blades of oars, bowed until I could see
the rolls of fat beneath his collar behind, then
shot at me out of eyes like two black currants
a glance that made me feel utterly disapproved-of
and “found wanting.” The girl gave me a
look less frankly measuring, while the whitest
teeth in the world flashed in her little face, oval
and smoothly olive as the shell of one of those
eggs on the table.</p>

<p>She was very lovely....</p>

<p>She held out her hand and gave mine the
violent shake that foreigners seem to think so
truly English; and then I slipped into the empty
place next to Blanche, feeling thankful for the
tea which Mrs. Waters handed to me in a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
cup decorated with a group of Welsh women
in the costume never seen except on china.</p>

<p>I drank it in a kind of thirsty dream; I couldn’t
have talked to save anyone’s life just then; but
the talk was buzzing on all around.</p>

<p>“—planned to go to-morrow; but shall you
be here?”</p>

<p>“—since we find ourselves in such charming
neighbourhood, we could prolong our
sojourn——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, <em>do</em> prolong it! So ripping for
Blanche and me to have Odette to go about
with! Of course, we never <em>see</em> Billy and Nancy
here!”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe her, Odette!” he was laughing
quite naturally.</p>

<p>“—can’t call your shore your own, this year!
<em>You</em> don’t know what it is to have an engaged
couple in the place!”</p>

<p>“No? It is not agreeable?” The pretty
French girl turned to smile at him again. “You
do not encourage me to come, so!”</p>

<p>“I’m writing a book about it——”</p>

<p>“Theo dear, finish your tea and don’t talk
so much!”</p>

<p>“‘The Complete Gooseberry’ it’s called,
if you know what that means.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Place where you find the little babies!
Yes?”</p>

<p>“No! not place! People! Unengaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
ones like us and you and everybody but
<em>Them</em>.”</p>

<p>“—Enchanted, madame!”</p>

<p>“—with rules like this: ‘<i>Don’t cough outside
doors; they hate it. Far better not go in</i>!’”</p>

<p>“—More hot water, please, Blodwen——”</p>

<p>“—<i>Don’t stalk them with a camera. You
never get anything worth printing!</i>”</p>

<p>“—And will I bring a two more fress negg,
mam?”</p>

<p>“<i>If one of them’s away, don’t ask who’s got
the ink!</i>”</p>

<p>“—No, but do you remember the bathing at
Dinard?”</p>

<p>“—Next year, perhaps——”</p>

<p>“—start before lunch——”</p>

<p>“—if the tide’s right——”</p>

<p>“—But Monsieur Charrier, as you were
saying——”</p>

<p>“—icy!”</p>

<p>“—as warm as warm!”</p>

<p>“How was it to-day, Nancy?”</p>

<p>“Nancy, I believe you stayed in too long,
dear,” murmured Mrs. Waters gently to me as
she passed my cup down again.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” I said vaguely,
trying to smile at her. She was the only one of
the party to whom I felt I could turn in my
utter fatigue and bewilderment. For in that
party I felt myself as a sort of plain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
neglected little nursery-governess. It seemed
impossible that anyone should ever have admired
<em>me</em>—that Major Montresor had ever paid me
compliments—or Sydney wanted to marry me!—or
that, for at least a moment, my employer
had found me attractive enough to flirt with.
I hadn’t looked at him, but I knew he hadn’t
glanced once at me. His attention was entirely
divided between Monsieur Charrier, to whom
he listened with a deference new to me, and that
pretty French fashion-plate in white and cream
and tango-colour, who laughed whenever her
host said anything at all.</p>

<p>Yes! She was very lovely. She made me
feel dowdy and drab and <i lang="fr">gauche</i> beyond words.
Even at my best I should have felt that she outshone
me; even if I did possess longer eyelashes
and a flush of pink and a dimple, what were
these compared with the finished <i lang="fr">chic</i> of the way
she wore hair and clothes—to her scintillating
vivacity? No wonder the man beside her was
so obviously lost in admiration of her!</p>

<p>Men adore a girl who’s “<em>bright</em>,” who amuses
them while she saves them the trouble of thinking
what to say. I believe that somewhere at
the back of every man’s mind there’s a fancy
portrait of himself, in a sultan’s turban, applauding
condescendingly while some fair dancing-girl
postures and performs for his pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Men!</em> Even the ones who have seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
“whitest,” as Jack calls it, turn out to be cads
in the end. Trying to flirt with the girl to whom
you’re nominally engaged, and whom you’ll
never marry, is the sort of “joke” that appeals
to a masculine sense of humour. Yes, even when
the possessor happens to be really attracted by
quite another girl. For it didn’t take me many
seconds of silent looking-on to see what game
was being played between my employer and
that girl.</p>

<p>“Odette, are these your gloves?”</p>

<p>He picked them up from the floor when at
last we all rose.</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> gloves, Billy,” retorted Mademoiselle
Charrier gaily. “Still a pair from the beautiful
great box you bought me. You remember,
yes?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the box you won from me at that flying-meeting.
Of course I remember.”</p>

<p>And I too remembered hearing of those gloves
and this bet, ages ago—the afternoon after I
had been out to lunch for the first time with
my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>.</p>

<p>So this was the young French girl he’d told
me about! And as I watched them standing
chatting together, a little apart from the group
round the motor outside, I suddenly gave a
quick guess at something else he might have had
to tell me about her if he’d chosen.</p>

<p><em>This very girl had something to do with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
official engagement to me!</em> Somehow or other,
she was his “reason” for appearing to have a
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> at all—a <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> upon whom he’d been
so particular to impress that “this affair would
never end in marriage!” Possibly my employer
and that girl were already secretly—but
really, not nominally—betrothed to one
another?</p>

<p>It looked like it. It looked uncommonly
like it.</p>

<p>At something he said she blushed quite rosily.
Oh, and they mustn’t think I didn’t notice her
shake of the head and her quick little silencing
frown at my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i> when her father, in
a tea-coloured alpaca dust-coat, at last left off
fussing over his engines and asked them if they—calling
them “<i lang="fr">mes enfans</i>”—were ready to
start?</p>

<p>“Oh—but are you going too, then, Billy?”
his mother put in quickly. Monsieur Charrier
answered with a flow of French about “<i lang="fr">affaires</i>,”
and documents which he had left at his hotel
in Holyhead, which it would be so much, so much
better if Mr. Waters would spare but a little
half-hour to investigate.</p>

<p>“Very good of you to give me the opportunity,
sir,” said Mr. Waters. “I can get a
train back, mother.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but no, but no! The auto will be again
at your service as soon as we have dined at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
dog of an hotel,” declared the stout Frenchman.
“I will bring your son home quite safely,
madame, to you and”—with a particularly
hollow show of politeness—“to mademoiselle!”</p>

<p>Here his daughter murmured something about
the four seats in the auto, plenty of space for
mademoiselle his <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> if she would deign to
accompany——</p>

<p>I expect Mademoiselle Charrier knew well
enough how safe it was to issue that invitation!
So did my employer, when he struck in with
“Ah, that’s very nice of you,” then turned
and addressed me directly for the first time since
we had walked up from the beach together.</p>

<p>“Yes! That would be a good idea, wouldn’t
it? You’ll come along too, won’t you, Nancy?
We could get a trap back.”</p>

<p>I excused myself as naturally as I could manage
it, with something about being rather tired.
It was true enough.</p>

<p>As that cherry-coloured car panted, jerked,
then whizzed off down the stone-wall-bordered
Holyhead road, with its trio of passengers, I
felt almost as if it had driven straight over me.</p>

<p>And I felt as if I shouldn’t have cared very
much one way or the other if it had!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST AVOWAL</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I suppose I must have dropped off to sleep
directly I threw myself down on my bed,
and have slept for some time.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk in my little bedroom;
outside my window veils of purple gauze were
drawn over sand-hills and shore, and the tide
was far out again by the time I was awakened by
a tap at my bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Yes?” I called drowsily, wondering, for
a second, where I was, and what horrible thing
it was that seemed lying in wait for me to wake
up properly and remember it.</p>

<p>The door opened and Mrs. Waters came in,
carrying a little tray.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you this, dear.” It was a glass
of ginger wine with two biscuits laid over the top
of it. “I know you stayed in the water too long
this afternoon; you were done up. Drink it
up, child.”</p>

<p>I sat up, and she put out her hand to smooth
my damp hair while I finished the glassful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>“That’s better, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Much, thank you,” I sighed gratefully; for
the wine had seemed very heartening, and heartening
was what I needed. The horrible memory
had come back to me. Two of them, in fact:
that of this morning, even before that of this
afternoon. His mother knew nothing of either;
<em>that</em> I read in the pink, December rose of a face
under the grey hair. The dear! and I must
leave her....</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you something else too,” she
said, almost shyly, like a schoolgirl who isn’t
sure that she won’t be snubbed; “something
you’ll like.”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her soft black muslin
bodice, unfastened something that was hidden
inside, and brought out a thin, old-fashioned
pendant of flat gold, slung on a slender golden
chain.</p>

<p>She opened it and held it out to me. I took
it in my hand and carried it to the window,
where there was still enough light by which to
see it well.</p>

<p>Coiled up below the oval glass, faintly gold
as thistle-down in sunshine, and fine as floss-silk,
there was a baby’s curl.</p>

<p>“That was the very first curl I ever cut from
Billy, the day that he was christened,” his mother
told me softly, sitting on the side of my bed,
while I stood, not knowing how to speak to her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
by the window. “He had such pretty hair
always!” she went on, “quite as pretty as Theo’s
is now. Only boys—men always seem to look
upon curly hair as a sort of affliction; they’re
never satisfied unless they’re flattening it out
with brushes and horrid stuff out of bottles,
are they? And when we all go back to Sevenoaks
again, Nancy—”</p>

<p>I lifted my head to try to interrupt her, to
say something about my being forced to go away
before, but no words came; she went on talking,
as if more to herself than to anyone else, of what
seemed, just then, almost unbearable to me.</p>

<p>—“I’ll show you heaps of other little things
that belonged to him as a baby. His very first
tiny shirt! They put new babies into shirts
then, you know. Fine linen, with narrow, real
lace round the neck and the little sleeves....
Oh, of course I know those silk-and-wool vests
they have now are much more sensible. I’m
<em>quite</em> modern, really. Still—there’s a lovely
embroidered christening-robe of his ... all his
robes. I made others for Blanche and Theo.
I’d a fancy to keep them all separate, so that
when they—my babies!—grew up and married
they could have them handed on. So all Billy’s
will be for you, Nancy—and the little locket.
I knew you’d care to keep it.”</p>

<p>“I?” I cried, aghast and huskily. I held it
back to her. “Oh, no! It’s not for me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>“Of course it is. I always meant to give
it to his bride on her wedding-morning.”</p>

<p>“Then you keep it for—for her, until then,”
I broke in, with a little laugh that sounded wild
in my own ears, and I pressed the pendant with
the christening-day curl back into his mother’s
hand. She said nothing for a moment.</p>

<p>Presently, in the dusk, I felt her long arm slip
round me, and her hesitating, gentle voice was
saying very earnestly and pitifully: “Nancy!
You do care for my boy, don’t you?”</p>

<p>And then into that day of queer and crowded
horrible happenings, there was packed yet
another.</p>

<p>In my own ears I heard my own voice answering
his mother’s appeal with words I could
scarcely recognize as my own. Yet it was no
freak of imagination this time. It was no mad
fancy like that on the beach. It was I, Monica
Trant, who in that voice so shaking and strained
cried desperately:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! <em>Yes!</em> You <em>know</em> I care for
him!”</p>

<p>And with that avowal in my ears I felt as if
some stranger had cried aloud a secret that I had
never even guessed, but that now—<em>now</em> I knew
to be coming true.</p>

<p>I found myself putting out my hands before
me, almost as if this growing knowledge were
something that I could hold away from myself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
For a time I must hold it away; I <em>must</em>! For
at least as long as I remained here. I clenched
my hands tightly, dropping them to my sides,
using all my will to bring myself to speak in my
usual voice again.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what time it is, Mrs.
Waters?”</p>

<p>“Half-past seven. You’ll go to bed early,
dear, won’t you? You won’t stop up!”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go to bed.”</p>

<p>“And to-morrow—Nancy, I don’t want to
say much more. Only, Life promises to be so
golden, dear, for you and him!”</p>

<p>It was then that she gave me a sting that I
wish I could forget. I <em>shall</em> forget, but not at
once, that his mother said:</p>

<p>“<em>Fate has been merciful to let you two meet.</em>
Don’t let that be spoiled! To-morrow——”</p>

<p>I held her hand with that little locket in it
clutched for a minute against my breast.</p>

<p>“It shall be different to-morrow,” I whispered
before she went, keeping my meaning to myself.
It will, of course, be “different” enough!</p>

<p class="tb">Half-past seven. There was just time, then,
to send my wire.</p>

<p>I crept out silently over the sand-hills and
away to the tiny post office where, thank goodness,
the postmistress’s literal English won’t allow
her to read much between the lines of this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Cicely’s answering wire—for a wonder
correctly worded—arrived this morning
at breakfast as I came down.</p>

<p>I’ve shown it to the Waters: explained
that I must be off at once. Only Theo protested
angrily, “Your chum ill? How <em>careless</em> of
her just when we were such a jolly party, and
going to Red Wharf Bay with the Charriers to-morrow,
and all!” The others accepted it
with scarcely a word. They didn’t even show
that they found it odd that Miss Harradine,
who lives in Battersea, should hand her telegram
in at Euston Station—though I wondered
over that myself. Not even Mrs. Waters said
a word to press me to wait and send a nurse
instead; she didn’t ask when I thought I might
come back. If she <em>looked</em> questions I didn’t
see them; I was steadfastly keeping my eyes for
breakfast-cups, and clocks, and time-tables, and
anything but the faces of these people I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
to leave—for good. All the morning I’ve spent
in my bedroom, packing-up.</p>

<p>Twice, while I was busily emptying drawers
and laying out my things in folded heaps on the
bed, I heard outside my window a whistle like
a blackbird’s note; but this time I wasn’t taken
in for a moment. I knew it wasn’t a blackbird.
I took no notice of him.</p>

<p>I went on packing, laying my string-soled
bathing shoes at the bottom of my trunk. A long
time before I shall need <em>those</em> again! I let
him whistle.</p>

<p>He tried something else.</p>

<p>Twice there was a sharp tap on the pane,
just as when that thrush was cracking a snail.
But I knew that this time it really was a pebble
thrown up to catch my attention: thrown,
not from the trimly-gravelled sweep in front of
a big house, but from the cottage garden planted
with sandy white pinks and lad’s-love—thrown
to bring me down. I wasn’t to be either
whistled or tapped to his side.</p>

<p>I rolled my sun-bonnet—there was a little rip
where it had caught on a gorse prickle—into
a tight pink bundle and rammed it down beside
my shoes.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going down.</p>

<p>Then came a crunching on the cobbles of the
path below, and a soft call of “Nancy!”</p>

<p>Not I; I wasn’t going down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>“Nancy!”—more urgently. “I say!”</p>

<p>No! Let him think what he liked of me—rude,
obstinate, childish, or sullen—as long as
he only didn’t guess <em>why</em> I didn’t mean to go
down, or even look out the window to answer
him. I couldn’t face it now. Not with what
my own lips had first told me of the thing which
I had to hold away from me, at arm’s length,
for as long as I had the strength.</p>

<p>“Nancy!”</p>

<p>Evidently he was set on saying something to
me—but whether it was about yesterday morning
or yesterday afternoon I didn’t care. I was
equally set on his not having the chance. Now
I was afraid this chance would happen after
lunch, and I was grateful to that which prevented
his taking me up to Holyhead and seeing
me off by the Euston mail alone.</p>

<p>I rejoiced over the timely and snorting arrival
of that magenta-coloured “auto” of the
Charriers, bringing over Monsieur with some
more of his business-documents, and Mademoiselle
with business that a child might guess at.</p>

<p>I leaped at their proffered lift of luggage and
all, back to Holyhead Station, and the four of
us went off together.</p>

<p>Then, sitting beside this French coquette,
who seemed bent on seeming sweet to me—(Why?
I suppose because the girl to whom he
<em>is</em> engaged feels that it’s “in the picture” to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
generous to the girl he <em>has</em> “engaged”)—my
heart sank, and I wished I hadn’t accepted. We
were speeding along far too fast along the level
road towards the purple hump of the Holyhead
mountain. We should be there too soon.
Heavens! There’d be half an hour to wait at
the station, and he could get what he wanted to
say in then....</p>

<p>Why hadn’t I thought of that! If something
would only happen....</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>Never, never has a motor breakdown been
hailed with delight before by a passenger; but
I blessed the fortunate accident that kept
Monsieur Charrier and my employer fumbling,
fidgeting and fuming about the bonnet for
over half an hour by the roadside. Mademoiselle,
in her lemon-coloured wrap and daring
little hat, sat on the top of a low stone fence
with me in my brown silk coat and skirt in which
I’d first travelled down to The Lawn. I was so
delighted by the delay that I could even laugh
quite gaily at her as she chattered.</p>

<p>“Always the same! Each time that we take
a passenger to make very quickly, there arrives
this <i lang="fr">malheur</i>!... Now, now, it is good?
it is well? it is right? No?... Regard
my father, Miss Nancy, on the earth under the
auto nearly: he look like a little fat dog that has
been run over, not? Ah look at this brave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
Billy, always the same idea, <i lang="fr">encore un</i> spanner!
Now he will lick her into shapes!... It is
finish, Billy? No?... Ah, he is doing it
express, on purpose.... You will loose the
train, and Mademoiselle must return with you—what
a chancey day!”</p>

<p class="tb">Mercy! Return with him?—the midnight
train would be impossible—I should be kept
until the next morning—Horrors! My heart
was in my mouth at the thought....</p>

<p>It was with two minutes to spare, however,
that we flung ourselves, with the hastiest of
thanks, out of the motor, and rushed into the
busy station that stretches down to the quay,
where a couple of slanted funnels seemed as
big as two leaning towers of Pisa painted red.
No time to lose. He found me a corner-seat
facing the engine, in a carriage with one other
lady. He attended to my luggage with the speed
and ease of a man who can make men obey, then
he looked straight at me and began: “I haven’t
time now, but look here, I shall——”</p>

<p>Again I baffled him.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to read!” I cried, as if in
dismay over the fact. “Will you fetch me a
paper—anything.”</p>

<p>With a little jerk of his shoulders he turned
away to the bookstall, and I sat back in my
corner looking dully out at the moving bustle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
on the platform below the big Norman Wilkinson
posters of steamboats on a moonlit sea. Why
couldn’t we start—it must be time! I’d said
good-bye to his people, said it as if I were
going no further than for one of my afternoon
tramps at Porth Cariad with him. Now it
was to him that I must say good-bye.... I
couldn’t take it in yet. I didn’t want to.
Above all, I didn’t want him to say it—or
anything else.</p>

<p>Again the situation was unexpectedly saved.</p>

<p>The carriage-door burst open, and a man,
panting with haste, flung a cape and a blue-covered
<cite>English Review</cite> on to the seat opposite
mine, drew his handkerchief over his brow
with a “Phew!” that meant “Only just done
it!” then leaped out again on to the platform,
calling, “Porter! when is this train due off?”</p>

<p>“She ought to be off now, sir; we’ve been
kept back by the boat, we’re ten minutes behind
time.”</p>

<p>But it was not this that made me sit up and
turn quickly to the man who’d dropped back
into the seat opposite to me. Slim shape, soft
hat, Vandyke profile—yes, I thought I’d recognized
the voice. Sydney Vandeleur, of all
people—and at this moment! At any other, I
might have longed to pick up that <cite>English
Review</cite> and hurl it at his picturesque head, but,
for just this one occasion, I was overjoyed to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
him. My employer wouldn’t be able to say any
last words now, before him.</p>

<p>“Monica—Miss Trant!” exclaimed Sydney
quickly. “How odd! Did you see <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p>“See whom?”</p>

<p>“Why, Cicely!”</p>

<p>Cicely! The tone in which he used her
Christian name told me all there was to know,
<em>there</em>! I’d thought so!</p>

<p>“I’ve been seeing her off, you know, to Ireland—the
Dublin boat—just gone off.” He nodded
towards the quay. “Had to get back to London
to-night; I am meeting the Mamma in Pont
Street to-morrow morning, and——”</p>

<p>“Take your seats, please! Take your seats!”
The guard’s whistle was at his lips as my official
<i lang="fr">fiancé</i> came racing back along the platform.
An armful of papers and magazines fell on to
my lap.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Nancy. And, I say! I’m
going to——”</p>

<p>What he was going to say broke off again with
a snap. And the last glance I had of his blonde,
sun-browned face and quick eyes showed them
frozen in a stare of utter astonishment at the
sight of my travelling-companion.</p>

<p>Yes—my goodness! What would he think
of finding me with Sydney again?—Sydney, whose
name has so often nearly cropped up between
us. Would he think——?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>What difference would it make if he did?</p>

<p>The train steamed out of the station across
the flat Anglesey country, between marshlands
ghostly-white with bog-cotton in the dusk....
What would he think?</p>

<p>This was what occupied me all the time Sydney
was talking, for he was in a mood to talk to anyone.
I, for example, was not the Rose, but I
had shared rooms with the Rose, and he was
eager to tell me about her, and how she had gone
to stay with his married sister until—something
or other to do with “the Mamma.” Poor Lady
Vandeleur, fated to see her only son falling in
love with such totally ineligible girls! First
a City typist at twenty-five shillings a week;
now a Bond Street mannequin!</p>

<p>But my employer didn’t know of this change.
How could he? He probably—yes, certainly!—imagines
things are as they might once have
seemed to be.</p>

<p>Will he think I arranged this?</p>

<p>“Of course you know her—but not as one
does now!—the last few weeks! We were
together at the Café Royal—He’s going to paint
her—Colouring!—Wonderful! You should have
seen the costume I designed for her—Five Arts
Ball——Purposely giving the effect of——Quite
in the period, of course!—People who
understand!—Such <i lang="fr">souplesse</i> of mind as she
has——” Sydney went on to the air.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
My whole attention was for someone very
different.</p>

<p>He can’t imagine I’d do anything so underhand!
Even if he did imagine that—well,
I couldn’t explain unless he asked. If he did
ask, I could explain less than ever! Oh, why
can’t I wipe four months straight out of this
year and begin again? But then, there would
have been Jack to help! But then, there would
have been Sydney.... I should have been
engaged to this creature before me in that hat,
talking of Cicely’s <i lang="fr">souplesse</i> of mind! If he—the
other one—only knew what I really think
of Sydney!</p>

<p>“Fancy,” I commented haphazard to the
rhapsodist before me. “Well; I do hope
everything will be all right.” And I took up
the magazine my employer had tossed on to my
lap—there was a picture on the cover of a pretty
Summer-girl looking over the sea—and prepared
to hold it up in front of me for the rest of the
journey.</p>

<p>Sydney—surprised and sulky—read his <cite>English
Review</cite>. Presently I refused his not too pressing
invitation to join him in the dining-car,
and he left me for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>For love, that robs us women of the appetite
for anything but Romance, seems to make men
even hungrier for their food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Eus-tern!” came the familiar Cockney bawl
again at last. “Eus-tern!”</p>

<p>It was a change, after what I’d been used
to for the last few weeks, to have to fend for
myself in the matter of luggage and a taxi.
One doesn’t specially look to men in love for
decent manners. Still—that other one knew
how to pay these attentions in spite of his
Odette and her gloves! Sydney’s evidently
the type that pays homage to the Well-Beloved
by being casual towards every other
woman. He seemed to efface himself until his
lukewarm offer of getting me a cab could be
answered from the cab-window.</p>

<p>“Ah—may I tell him to drive to Marconi
Mansions, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told him, thanks. How fearfully hot
it is here, and how stuffy”—I sniffed with
distaste—“after the country!”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?—one’s almost consoled for Her
being away, in that lovely, soft, pure air of Ballycool!
Good night!”</p>

<p>The last sort of night I thought I’d have!
But once back in my familiar little camp-bed
in Marconi Mansions, I tucked my cotton
dressing-gown round me because no sheets had
been left out, and fell into that dreamless trance
of utter tiredness.</p>

<p>I slept like a log all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>(<i>Next day.</i>)</p>

<p><em>How</em> the flat seems to have shrunk! and what
a state Cicely has left it in! Has she moved
<em>all</em> our ramshackle furniture since I was here
last? Used that table to be right in the middle
of the room, choking it up like this?—and where’s
my dear print of “Kitty Fisher” that used to
hang just <em>there</em>, where she’s put that framed oil-sketch
of—what on <em>earth</em>? It looks like a study,
by Blossom, of that coloured tie of Sydney’s—and
there’s a little red “<i>sold</i>” label on it. I
suppose he bought it for her out of one of the
shows at the Grafton Gallery. The couch, too,
is littered with books ... Marinetti ...
Schnitzer ... Tangore ... Strindberg’s
“<cite>Stronger Woman</cite>” ... a slender volume,
“<cite>The Everlasting Mercy</cite>,” inscribed “<i>To
Cicely, from her devoted S. V.</i>”</p>

<p class="tb">H’m! Cicely among the intellectuals? Well,
I suppose some of us are made adaptable as
water, taking the shape of any vessel we’re poured
into by Man. Perhaps—perhaps I might have
been the same, if——</p>

<p>But I do wish she’d had the <i lang="fr">souplesse</i> or the
<em>something!</em> to throw away, before she left,
this litter of florists’ half-dead flowers, expensive
stale roses and carnations, that fills up every one
of our pots and crocks.</p>

<p>I’d better do it, I suppose....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<p>Also I’d better wash up my breakfast-things—and
Cicely’s of the day before, which are heaped
upon the kitchen table.</p>

<p>On the top of an oily quarter-pound of
butter there’s a very dirty note.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Dear Miss I am unable to come to-day has
my little girl is queer hoping no inconvenence yrs
truely mrs skinner.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>All right. I’ll wash up ... loathsome job!
That kettle always took so long to boil—we
ought to have a flat-bottomed one like the one
they use for picnics at the Waters’. It’s a good
thing I’m able to think so composedly of them.
Doesn’t it show, after all, that—what I told
his mother, what I thought I should have to
hold away from myself so determinedly, may not
really be true ... may not, anyhow, be the
deep and lasting sort of “true” that I imagined?
Just a fancy, a passing, summer-holiday attraction
for someone who’ll never guess. It must—it
<em>shall</em> be that. No harm in remembering him—all
of them. Let’s see. To-day was to be
their excursion to Red Wharf Bay. I can see
the whole party—and their jolly, sun-browned
faces against the throbbing blue of sea and sky.
Odette Charrier will be like some bright foreign
bird just alighted amid the homely gold of the
Welsh gorse ... prattling away in her pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
broken English that I believe she sometimes
breaks on purpose to hear Billy Waters’ amused,
boyish laugh.</p>

<p>They’ll be together all the time to-day—no
official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> to intervene with even the shadow
of a claim....</p>

<p>Together they’ll be unpacking the picnic
basket, hunting for the corkscrew, picking up
big, sun-warmed pebbles from the beach to
lay at the corners of the white picnic cloth to
keep it from flying into the sea.</p>

<p>The others will be—oh, somewhere about....</p>

<p>Those two will stroll off after lunch, I suppose.
I wonder if they’ll bathe? <em>He</em> wouldn’t have
lost his nerve even after that afternoon swim....
<em>Only yesterday?</em> They’ll bathe from the
rocks, I expect. And I might still have been
there....</p>

<p>A ring at the door of the flat. Milk, Mrs.
Skinner, or—what?</p>

<p>I’d better go and see....</p>

<p class="tb">They call <em>us</em> the unexpected sex, of whom no
man can ever say what we shall be at next.</p>

<p>What about themselves?</p>

<p>Only last evening I’d left him standing, stiff
with astonishment, on the Holyhead platform.
This morning here he was again, blocking up
the tiny entrance to our flat—my official <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>!</p>

</div>

<p>Thank heaven for the instinct that silenced
the welcoming “Billy!” before it broke
from my lips. Thank heaven also for that numbness
all over me that allowed me to say in a voice
as detached as if it had been the piano-tuner
to whom I’d just opened the door, “Oh! good
morning.”</p>

<p>“Good morning.” A tone as blank as a
whitewashed wall between him and me. “I
suppose you are surprised to see me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I—yes, I am, of course.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect me.”</p>

<p>“No.” We both glanced down at my sleeves,
still rolled up from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I have something to say to you,” he went on
in that same tone. His face I couldn’t see in
that little, dark drainpipe of a passage where we
stood. “That’s why I came.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>What could it be that brought him an eight
hours’ journey on my track? Surely not that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
foolish old out-of-date apology still—or those
unwanted thanks for saving his life.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to hear what it is?”</p>

<p>“Er—yes; oh, yes,” reluctantly. “But I’m
sorry I can’t ask you to sit down here; you see
my friend is away——”</p>

<p>“Oh! She’s <em>away</em>. I’m glad she’s well
enough. I thought she was ill.”</p>

<p>This I didn’t know how to meet.</p>

<p>“Where may I speak to you, then?” he added.</p>

<p>“Is it—about something very important?”</p>

<p>“Important enough to bring me up to London
by the midnight train after you’d left. I just
had a bath and breakfast at an hotel and came
on here. So—”</p>

<p>Evidently there was no getting out of it.</p>

<p>—“Will you come out and talk? If it’s not
troubling you too much,” he added stonily.</p>

<p>“Well, if you will wait until I put on my
hat and coat,” I said slowly, “I will come out
into Battersea Park with you. We can sit down
there.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes we were sitting side by side
on a couple of green-backed wooden chairs on
the path that faces the sluggish brown river and
the barges that slid slowly between us and the
tower of Old Chelsea Church.</p>

<p>Why had he come?</p>

<p>“Important,” he’d said. Was it a recall?
Must I go back for the five remaining months<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
of my year’s contract? I remembered, then,
that it was in writing—I’d forgotten that!
Must I return to Porth Cariad to serve the
purpose of him and that girl?</p>

<p>If he insisted, I must.</p>

<p>I should be glad—(not, not to be with <em>him</em>
again! That passing feeling I should no doubt
manage to kill. I <em>must</em> kill it)—to be back
with his mother and Blanche and Theo in that
golden Anglesey, instead of in this baked and
dusty park, rowdy with Board-school children
on holiday. For the sake of the <em>place</em> I could
forget the man I was with; I could ignore
that morning when we painted the figure-head!
Thank heaven I was feeling so like “a wooden
woman” myself.</p>

<p>For another moment I was kept waiting,
wondering what he would say. Three words
told me everything.</p>

<p>They swept aside so many things that up to
then had seemed real and undeniable enough.
They did away with hours in a music-room, of
another hour in the dusk under a copper-beech,
when overtures were made of a friendship that
seemed as if it were going to work all right,
(“<i>You could be such a little brick to me!</i>”)
but had broken down because, after all, he was a
man and I a girl—even though I didn’t happen
to be the right girl.... Those weeks of gay,
open-air comradeship in Wales, that morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
of sunshine and hotly-snatched kisses on a cliff
among the gorse, that afternoon of a race and a
struggle for life in the jade-green waters of a
bay.... All these were to be as though they’d
never been.</p>

<p>It was all over in those three words:</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant!”</p>

<p>The unexpected sex? Oh, no! It’s we who
can be trusted to do just what’s expected of <em>us</em>
by our nearest man: to be heroic, petty, clinging
or capable. He meant me to be utterly
business-like and formal. Well, he found me
so, my tone just matching his own.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Waters?”</p>

<p>“It’s about this nominal engagement of ours.
That was to go on for a year, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be glad to hear it needn’t last so
long, after all.”</p>

<p>“Not a year?”</p>

<p>“Not any longer at all. I’ve come to release
you now.”</p>

<p>I found absolutely nothing to say. It
was as if I’d been preparing to walk down a
long corridor that stretched before me, and
had found, after I’d gone a yard, that a door
was slammed in my face. I seemed to stare
at blank walls in every other direction....
I’d better say something.... What was there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you for letting me know.” Then,
“As this has only lasted so much less than the
time you said, I will send back to you my cheque
for——”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the kind, please,”
curtly. “I made the arrangement. I break
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that money——”</p>

<p>“I shall not take it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I shall send it somewhere, then,” I told
him, and glanced round at the nearest group
of grimy little Cockneys on the brown grass.
“The Fresh Air Fund.”</p>

<p>“As you please.”</p>

<p>A pause. I was wondering if he meant me
to say anything else. He began again. “I
expect you guess my reason for this change of
arrangement.”</p>

<p>“I think—I do,” I said.</p>

<p>Yes, I thought, whatever it was that stood
between him and an open engagement to Mademoiselle
Charrier must be at an end, and Miss
Trant, alias “Nancy,” is no longer needed for
the rôle of the red herring on the trail. But
his next remark almost startled me out of my
chair.</p>

<p>“Ah! You mean you quite realize that in
breaking this contract, I’m considering <em>your</em>
feelings. It is for <em>your</em> sake.”</p>

<p>“<em>Mine?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>“Naturally!” he said sharply. “When I
saw that the arrangement had become so irksome
to you—when I saw <em>why</em>——”</p>

<p>I turned to stare up at his temper-set face,
repeating “When?”</p>

<p>“Need you ask when? Last night,” he said,
still more sharply, “at Holyhead Station.”</p>

<p>Ah! Then he <em>had</em> thought—what I’d
wondered about. It was my turn to look set
with anger; I know I flushed. Let him go on.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, first thing in the morning, you
get that wire, handed in at Euston. A message
that’s obviously—well, a fake. Didn’t you
arrange to receive it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted shortly. “I did.”</p>

<p>“Ah. I knew that, Miss Trant. Following
on that, I find you travelling back to London
the very same evening with that—that friend
of yours, Mr. Vandeleur. Rather a coincidence.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” I said, my heart thumping with
rage, partly against Cicely’s adorer for making
this trouble, partly against this other man with
his savage tone and suspicious eyes, “that you
think I told him to send the wire!”</p>

<p>“There was the wire! And there <em>he</em> was.”</p>

<p>“Even if it had been so, why not?”</p>

<p>“With you engaged to me?”</p>

<p>“Nominally!”</p>

<p>“Makes no difference to the circumstances!”
he shot out. “Who knows that, but you and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
I? To anyone else, it would have looked
uncommonly——”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it!” I declared, but I saw
the reason of his anger and it made me angrier
still. <em>His</em> dignity compromised! His official
dignity as a <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>! So I had heard of married
men, with wives to whom they were utterly
indifferent, still showing that furious male
jealousy of other men. “But I should have
been doing nothing against our contract.”</p>

<p>“Nothing against the letter of it, you think?
But when I asked you to enter into it, one of my
first questions, you’ll remember, was whether
you were already engaged.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well! I shouldn’t have troubled you if
I’d known all this. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Known all <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>“Remember, it’s not the only time I’ve seen
you with him!” he went off at a tangent.
“There was that first occasion—at the Carlton.
I thought there seemed something, when he
congratulated me! And then that time at the
flat. He had eyes for nothing but you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>hadn’t</em> he!” I was breaking in, but
my late employer went on with his indictment.</p>

<p>“Even Montresor, at our house, seemed to
know all about it! And now his meeting you
in Wales—You won’t tell me that wasn’t by
appointment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<p>“I will,” I said, lifting my head. “I do,
Mr. Waters. It wasn’t.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“Please take my word.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you say so!” he agreed quickly.
Then, more quickly still, “But if he didn’t
send that telegram, who did?”</p>

<p>“You saw it! It was signed.”</p>

<p>“Yes; by your friend Miss Harradine. That
says nothing. You asked her to send it—wired
the night before, perhaps.... Didn’t you?”
he cross-examined me. “Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well—if I did? Yes!”</p>

<p>“Why did you, Miss Trant?”</p>

<p>I looked away from him, mutinous but helpless,
at the border of the path in front, with its little
clumps of heat-shrivelled purple pansies, drooping
over the powdery earth. There was something
that no cross-examination should get out
of me! Let him know that I couldn’t bear to
stay in the same place with him—first, because
he’d kissed me; next, because there was no
reason that he should ever kiss me again ...
every reason that he would not? Never!</p>

<p>“Why had you to go?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I cried, with a little stamp of my shoe
on the gravel. “Why need you pry into—into
what’s my affair alone? Is even an <em>official
fiancée</em> allowed to keep nothing to herself?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said savagely. Then, off at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
another tangent, “But at least you won’t tell
me that the fellow didn’t want to marry you
himself?”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make if he did?
That was ages ago, months!” I let out hastily.
“Anyhow—one’s not supposed to tell these
things, but, as we’re talking business, I may
tell you as a business-secret that I refused
him!”</p>

<p>“You did?”—quickly. “Was this before—before
our arrangement was made?”</p>

<p>“N-no. Just afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You weren’t free, you thought.
Otherwise——May I ask if you would have
accepted him?”</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to ask!”</p>

<p>“I know that,” he admitted angrily, “but
have you—had you a right to make me look
foolish—about him?”</p>

<p>“I never have done that!” I snapped. “You
believe me that last night was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he argued, “but you must confess
that other things look rather mysterious.”</p>

<p>“Mysterious? Need <em>you</em> talk about things
being mysterious,” I argued back, “when the
whole of what you wanted me for has been such
a mystery to me? You’ve never given me a
hint of the reason!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been able to! You were to have
known later! But about this other——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span></p>

<p>He broke off as a mild-looking old man plumped
himself down on the green seat next his, and began
to scatter crumbs out of a paper-bag to the sooty
sparrows twittering on the path.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, here——”</p>

<p>“I am rather deaf,” said the bird-feeder,
mildly looking up, “and quite elderly. Don’t
mind me.”</p>

<p>Still Waters looked as if he could have choked
him with his paper-bag.</p>

<p>“We’ll walk about a bit, if you don’t mind,”
he said curtly to me.</p>

<p>And it seems to me now that for hours and
hours we two walked Battersea Park, talking,
talking, still repeating ourselves over “<i>that
wire</i>” and “<i>nothing to do with you</i>” and “<i>yes,
but I’d at least a right to object to your making
me look</i>——” ... Round the lake we went,
up and down the path of the river front, on the
broad bald grass patches, passing communities
of little motherly girls with perambulators and
picnic-bags in the shadow of the elms, skirting
little boys’ cricket-matches conducted with
crooked bats, shrill yells—it was all noise and
glare and dust that morning, and I couldn’t really
say why we should be walking up and down in it
like this, endlessly discussing what had no point,
now.... Hadn’t we come, long ago, to the
end?</p>

<p>At last he did raise a fresh point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>“Anyhow,” he blurted out, “I stand in your
way no longer.”</p>

<p>This roused me beyond all the rest.</p>

<p>“D’you mean,” I cried, exasperated, “in the
way of my possibly marrying Mr. Vandeleur?”</p>

<p>“Exactly!”</p>

<p>Was I to stand this? Was I to let him go
away imagining <em>that</em> was the sort of girl I was?
Was I to allow him, later on, to think of his
official ex-<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> (if he ever thought of her
again) as being quite contented to accept a dangling
<i lang="fr">dilettante</i> with those tastes and that tie,
an indoor object who pottered amiably about
Art-galleries and girls’ studios, between the Tiny
Theatre and the Cave of the Cub, a pampered
amateur who couldn’t earn his living to
save his life?... was a real man to think of
me, married to That? No—fear!</p>

<p>So I said, very distinctly, “Even if his extremely
easy attention <em>hadn’t</em> been caught by
another girl—the girl he was seeing off to the
Irish boat last night at Holyhead, if you must
know!—even if he were the only man left on
board a—a desert-island, I shouldn’t want to
marry Sydney Vandeleur, so now you know!—And
you needn’t think, as men always <em>do</em> think,
that it’s sour grapes!” I rushed on before he
could put in a word. “You might ask my chum
about that—the very afternoon we had tea there
I nearly offended her by letting her see what I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
thought of <em>him</em>!—even though he still imagined
himself in love with me——”</p>

<p>Here I broke off, for a flying cricket-ball from
one of those shrieking teams we passed had
knocked off my companion’s straw hat. He had
to pick it up and then to sling the ball in back
to the small and grimy bowler before he could
speak; and I, worked up to it now, didn’t see
why he, the man, should be allowed the passing
of every vote of censure, so I went on:</p>

<p>“As for your accusing me of making you look
foolish, Mr. Waters, what about you, with me?
What about the other girl? I was, after all,
your official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>. And—and in that capacity,
I might just as well have objected to your paying
so much attention to <em>her</em>!”</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he took up very sharply,
stopping on the path. “When have you seen
me with another girl?”</p>

<p>“Why! Yesterday! The day before, too!”</p>

<p>“<em>What——?</em>” he said, long drawn-out.
“Can you mean—<em>can</em> you mean the daughter
of Monsieur Charrier?”</p>

<p>(What did he imagine? Could I mean the
figure-head of the <i>Gwladys Pritchard</i>?)</p>

<p>“Of course I mean Mademoiselle Cha——”</p>

<p>“Object to Odette Charrier?” he cried,
almost as loudly as Theo might have done.</p>

<p>And, staring up at him, I saw that the set mask
of his face had broken up into its broadest, most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
boyish smile. His eyes were full of laughter
and delight....</p>

<p>Ah! How she must hold him, I thought,
for her very name so to irradiate him in a
moment!</p>

<p>“<em>That</em>,” he said, with the laughter running
through his voice,“was so utterly different.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! It’s always ‘different’ in one’s
own case. You and another girl can do as you
choose—but you wouldn’t have allowed an inch
to me and another man—<em>you</em> mustn’t be compromised.
Well, you should know your own
side of it. All that, I suppose, is what you can’t
tell <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” he said again, and all the smile
went out of his face. “This <em>dashed</em> tangle!”</p>

<p>“But considering it’s all at an end now,” I
said reasonably enough, “why need we go on
talking about it?” And then I found that I
was holding my breath in suspense.</p>

<p>Terrified suspense lest he should take me at
my word....</p>

<p>I knew then. I knew why I felt so. If we
<em>could</em> only “go on”! I asked for nothing more.</p>

<p>More clearly with each minute, these hours
had been showing me one thing at least. Whatever
he chose to say, however he rated me, dictated
to me what I should or should not have
done—to listen to his voice was pure joy. Just
to be—in Battersea, Anglesey, anywhere!—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
sea itself, but <em>with him</em>, was like coming out of a
stifling tunnel into sunshine and air.</p>

<p>He didn’t want me, but I was helplessly his.</p>

<p>A mere summer-holiday attraction? No,
so much the worse for me. <em>That</em> wouldn’t have
meant this sense that every thread of me was
knit up and together into one strand that drew
me, tied me to him; and must be broken or unravelled
now; for neither broken nor unravelled
threads are much more good for working!</p>

<p>A passing fancy? Not it; not this helpless
enchantment that had been growing and growing
over me—for how long I didn’t know. It
didn’t even allow me to wish that I’d never known
the man beside me except as Still Waters of the
Near Oriental, that I’d never seen him in his
home, never listened to tones of his voice unknown
before, never realized what a perfect
darling he could be, this “real Billy,” or how
it would be heaven to be made love to by him!</p>

<p>His hand up the cliff-path once or twice....</p>

<p>Three kisses ... three-and-a-half, if I count
that Sevenoaks time, were all I should have to
think of for the rest of my life.... Wildly I
thought that, if he suggested it, I’d be humbly
content to remain his official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> for ever.
Only not to be sent away! Not to be cut off
from the sight and sound of him! Not left to
a life that must be all echoes and shadows;
desperate, threadbare memories of everything he’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
looked and said, every note of his songs, the very
gestures with which he’d feel in his coat-pocket
for matches, each movement of his lips and eyes!</p>

<p>I had to keep my own eyes resolutely from his
as we turned away from the cycle-track, afraid
that even he might notice.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped again.</p>

<p>Already?</p>

<p>I daren’t look at him. I looked down at his
shadow on the dusty road, a pool of black—the
sun was high above us, time was getting on.
And I mustn’t show him how desperately I
would have clutched it back if I could. (Oh,
to think of those other hours, days—a whole
long week of them!—that I had wasted in sulks,
in “baiting” him, at The Lawn!)</p>

<p>We were standing by one of the bridges.
Here, where I had once thrown away flowers
of his—oh! how could I?—I remembered
something else that must come into our parting.
A smaller thing, but a more barbed one. Not
to be shirked, though.</p>

<p>“Your ring!” I said.</p>

<p>I took it off and handed it to him.</p>

<p>It flashed its green and blue and orange sparks
in the sunlight as it lay in his palm. He looked
at it, hard. No harder than I did. I was
looking my good-bye to something that had
meant so little—and so much. Too much. I
didn’t know how I was going to bear another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
second of this; and then, quickly, he closed his
brown hand over his diamonds and dropped them
into his jacket-pocket. Gone.</p>

<p>Then, looking eastward over the bridge, he
said, “We’d a discussion about this before.”</p>

<p>“Had we?” I said.</p>

<p>I wondered what had become of my pride,
so frantically was I hoping that this might lead
to another “discussion” now. Anything to
keep him for another few minutes.... That
gesticulating <i lang="fr">trèfle</i>-scented French beauty would
have him for the rest of her life; she might spare
him to me for just one more squabble!</p>

<p>“Yes: don’t you remember how you informed
me you’d send the ring back at the
year’s end? I said then——But look here!”
he broke off, “isn’t there anywhere near here
where we could get some lunch while we settle
about this?”</p>

<p>Ah! Then I should have my few minutes
longer!</p>

<p class="tb">There’s a little creamery in the King’s Road
where he and I lunched together again: this
time off rolls and butter and boiled eggs. There
he began again. “An engaged girl who had
been <em>really</em> engaged,” he said, “would insist
upon sending back the ring as a matter of course;
but why in this case?”</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>It was just because I was so afraid of seeming
to linger, as I longed to do, that I appeared to
be in such haste to finish the meal that nearly
choked me, and to draw a glove over that ringless
finger that felt, suddenly, so bare and unfamiliar—and
lonely.</p>

<p>“You’ll have coffee, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” Oh, why hadn’t I said,
“Yes”?</p>

<p>He’d lost that scowl, he seemed so much nearer
the old friendly terms again, and it was for the
last time!</p>

<p>“I will; unless you’re in a hurry, Miss Trant?
Just a moment—”</p>

<p>Yes! Just a moment! It was all I asked,
that, and that my heart should not beat so fast
and make me feel so weak and dizzy.</p>

<p>—“Here, boy!”—this was to a newspaper-boy
who was strolling past the shop behind a large
pink poster and a bundle of early evening editions.</p>

<p>“D’you mind if I just look up something——”</p>

<p>The man opposite to me unfolded the still
damp sheet; his eyes on the paper gave mine the
chance of one more direct, long, hungry look
at his face.</p>

<p>Then came surprise on surprise.</p>

<p>I saw his face change utterly, turn blank,
agitated. An odd-sounding “<em>Ah!</em>” broke from
his lips. Then he looked up again alert, decisive.</p>

<p>He stuffed the paper into his pocket, paused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
one instant, frowning in thought. Then counter-ordered
the coffee.</p>

<p>“No time for it,” he said. Then rose to take
his hat from the rack beside the little mirror.</p>

<p>So soon? Oh, so soon? What had brought
this about? Why “no time”? It seemed
scarcely a minute since I’d opened the door of
our flat to him, and now he was off! In this
hurry! Why?</p>

<p>But that didn’t matter. What mattered was
that, after all, I was a soldier’s daughter: that
it was expected of our family that they should
show no sign of being under fire, and that I’d
got to go through what was coming without a
tremor or glance to betray the sick sinking of
the heart within me; lightly and steadily,
holding myself well in hand. Afterwards I
could get back to the flat....</p>

<p>So, as one tells the dentist, “I’m ready—<em>now!</em>”
before a wrench, I picked my minute and
was holding out my hand to him as he turned
from the waitress.</p>

<p>I must say it first.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, Mr. Waters!”</p>

<p>He didn’t seem to hear that.</p>

<p>“Miss Trant, I find I’ve got to get down to
the City at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?” (It sounded all right, I think.)
“Then here we part company.”</p>

<p>Sharply concise, in his old orders-for-the-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
voice, came Still Waters’ “No. If you don’t
mind, I want you to come on with me.”</p>

<p>With him?</p>

<p>And presently I was whizzing down King’s
Road to Sloane Square in a taxi beside him,
wondering, as even he had never made me
wonder yet, what this further unexpectedness
might mean. He said nothing. He was intent
upon the paper he had taken out again.</p>

<p>Business, of course—but why take me with
him?</p>

<p>At the post office he stopped the cab, got out
and strode to the telephone, then out again.</p>

<p>“As quick as you can,” he told the driver,
“to the Near Oriental Shipping Company’s
offices, Leadenhall Street.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST GLEAM</span></h2>

</div>

<p>At the office, which to my experience seemed
to belong to a previous existence, but to
my eyes seemed only of yesterday, every familiar
object was in its place and unchanged. The
first of these was the figure of Mr. Dundonald.
He confronted us just outside the door of the
Principal’s office, and after a bow to me which
a week ago would have made me long to shriek
with amusement, came forward with his most
<i lang="fr">affairé</i> manner and said something, gravely and
in a low voice, to his chief.</p>

<p>“I know. Can’t attend to it now. Presently!”
the Governor put him aside, but also seriously.
“When Mr. Albert Waters comes in; I’ve
’phoned him. Send the boy to me when I
ring.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the door of his room.</p>

<p>Here, too, all looked exactly as it had done
that afternoon four months and an eternity
ago! The light and spaciousness of it, the mile-walk
stretch of deep red carpet, the round-topped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
mahogany clock on the wide mantelshelf, that
big desk, bare but for the turnover date ticket
upon it, his revolving chair in front of it, and
that other plump green-morocco-covered arm-chair
that he had first pointed at, that afternoon,
for me to take.</p>

<p>He pointed to it now.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please.”</p>

<p>Down I sat, watching him as he turned to the
desk. He was writing rapidly telegraph-forms.
Then his hand went out to the well-known row
of electric bell-pushes on his desk. One thing
there, after all, was new: the extending bracket-telephone.
Ah, yes; he’d put that in his
letter....</p>

<p>The equally well-known sharp little Cockney
face of Harold appeared at the door; the boy
came up and took the forms, which the Governor
had gathered into two bundles.</p>

<p>“These to go off at once. These to be
coded.”</p>

<p>“Yessir.”</p>

<p>I sat there wondering. If this business of his
meant so much haste, why had he made Mr.
Dundonald wait for it? Above all, what had
I to do with it that I should be there at all?</p>

<p>We were alone again. He glanced at the
clock, then wheeled round in his chair and
faced me. He spoke with matter-of-fact
politeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Miss Trant! I suppose you want
to know what all this is about? Not only my
bringing you on here, but about the whole of
our past arrangement?”</p>

<p>Did I want to know? After all, what did
it matter to me now? For me, all had been
summed up in his dropping of my—of his name
for me, and in the remembrance of another
girl’s laughing face. What stones would he
give <em>her</em> to wear? Not diamonds.... I said
nothing.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you,” he began again, “now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think any explanation was
promised when you drew up that contract,”
I said wearily. “I don’t really mind ...
you needn’t trouble.” ...</p>

<p>“I might <em>wish</em> to clear it up,” he suggested.
“Well, suppose we begin with this.”</p>

<p>He handed over to me the newspaper which
seemed to have hurled such a bomb at him.</p>

<p>I read the paragraph his finger marked as he
passed it to me.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">END OF THE FREIGHT WAR.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From our Hamburg Correspondent.</i></p>

<p>I am in a position to state that an
arrangement has been completed between
the interests represented by Messrs.
Holmes, Laing &amp; Co., of Liverpool, and a
powerful combination of this port, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
the Allgemeine——is chief. The terms
of the compact are naturally secret, but it
is believed that they include a large setting
apart of capital for the purpose of carrying
on the recent freight war to lengths that
no rival combination can hope to equal.
Should such a combination care to lease
the river, it can ascertain to what extent
the amalgamation is “bluffing.” From
the point of view of exporters generally,
this will mean that the cheap rates that
have obtained during the last two years
to all ports of the Near East will not last
much longer.</p>

</div>

<p>I read it again. I was feeling much too tired
and stupid to read newspapers—a lengthy, fruitless
and exhausting occupation at any time, I
consider.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” I said forlornly, passing it
back, “that this doesn’t convey very much to
me.”</p>

<p>He smiled, I thought as much as to say, “These
<em>business</em>-girls!”</p>

<p>Then he said, “Well, but you’ve met this
Monsieur Charrier, this big French shipping
man, in Anglesey? Perhaps you didn’t realize
that I’d business reasons for remaining on
cordial terms—keeping in with him at all costs?
Anyhow I may tell you now that this was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
view of the amalgamation which he and my
firm might be forming. I couldn’t, you understand,
say anything before, but there was to be
an alliance——”</p>

<p>“Yes?” (Between himself and that Charrier
girl. Why go on explaining it all to me? I
didn’t want to hear all this.) But he went on
more quickly:</p>

<p>“You saw the sort of man he was. Touchy,
excitable, easily put off! I had to be always on
my guard with him. So that when I heard
that he—this important person to me, Miss
Trant—seemed inclined to do me the honour
of selecting me, not only as a business-ally, but
also—”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at me. Of course I
was attending, if that was what he meant!</p>

<p>—“also as a possible son-in-law, what was
I to do?”</p>

<p>I said nothing. Of course he could do nothing
but accept such a bride with enthusiasm; but
why apologize to <em>me</em>?</p>

<p>“I realized,” he went on, “that I might
offend him to the verge of breaking off the other
deal. I explained to you at our first interview
here that I’d <em>had</em> no intention of getting
married?”</p>

<p>(Had. Then he’d fallen in love with her
later.)</p>

<p>“Last Easter, which we spent at Dinard with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
the Charriers,” he went on, “I—we all were
on the most friendly terms with Mademoiselle
Charrier—”</p>

<p>I clenched my hands together; they were
feeling, on that August afternoon, cold as ice.</p>

<p>—“And she was soon quite confidential to <em>me</em>,”
continued the Governor. “Told me lots of
things about herself, just like a child—”</p>

<p>(A minx! That assumed frankness!)</p>

<p>—“told me, even, of her own understanding
with a young airman who was over there then.
A secret from her people—you know what these
French parents are—but I don’t suppose it’s
a secret any longer now this is all up.”</p>

<p>(Ah, no! Odette Charrier wouldn’t find
it hard to jilt an airman or an archangel—for
him!)</p>

<p>“It was she herself who told me, perfectly
candidly, of her father’s idea of the offer of her
hand to me. You know that rum French way
they have—pretty awkward, that,” went on the
Governor, beginning to speak almost as rapidly
as for that dictation he used to gabble off to me.
“I was in a tight corner then! There was
the risk of turning a possible friend—and such
a powerful one!—into a certain enemy. I
knew how offended he’d be by a refusal that
<em>might</em> seem due to reluctance! Then there
was the young lady to consider—What’s the
matter, don’t you follow me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>“No—I don’t understand,” I made myself
say quite coherently, “what you mean by
‘refusal.’”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>she</em> didn’t want to marry me! She’d
got this aviator-chap. <em>I</em> didn’t want to marry
anybody—then.”</p>

<p>(<em>Then.</em> Was he going to inflict upon me the
whole of their love-story?)</p>

<p>“And I could only forestall the proposal she
told me he meant to make by showing her father
some really tangible proof that I was out of the
question. You see?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said slowly. “<em>I</em> was—a nominal
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> was to be the tangible proof.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Well! Now comes the news that
does away with that necessity. I’d been expecting
the corroboration of it for some days.
However, it’s out at last; here.” He tapped
the paper. “It means that the alliance Waters-Charrier
has been knocked on the head; it means
that my firm isn’t going to be quite the almighty
concern I hoped it might; but it also means
that something—a big thing!—is saved out of
the fire: namely, that I needn’t take these
drastic measures to avoid Monsieur Charrier’s
displeasure. If I don’t want to marry into his
family, I can say so if I choose.”</p>

<p>(<em>If—!</em> He meant that <em>now</em> Odette and he
could show that theirs was nothing but a love-match!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>

<p>“And if I hadn’t broken off our nominal
engagement this morning, Miss Trant, I should
be able to do it this afternoon; <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>This meant that he was positively eager to
get rid of me. Knife-thrust as it was, I was
glad to feel it. It spurred me for what I had
to do, this time without even being allowed
to pick my minute; to rise, smile conventionally,
hold out my hand in farewell.</p>

<p>He took it lightly, dropping it almost at once.
In a tone of unmistakable, undisguised relief
he added, “So that’s the end of <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” I returned, quite casually enough
to deceive a man, though it took my last ounce
of effort. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I said ‘the end of <em>that</em>,’”
took up my late employer. “Now here’s something
that begins. Will you sit down again,
please?”</p>

<p>The influence of the place we were in, I
suppose, made me obey him. Again I sat back
in the green-leather chair, wondering if it made
it better or worse to have this leave-taking
so dragged out, wondering why he chose this
form of torture.</p>

<p>He came and stood above me. He began,
quite gently, “I’ve taken your word that that
about Vandeleur was an accident, not an appointment.
Well, then! If it wasn’t on <em>his</em> account
that you had that wire sent to recall you, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
wasn’t because of <em>him</em> you bolted like that from
me—from Anglesey,” he spoke more emphatically,
“<em>Why was it?</em>”</p>

<p>Again this cross-examination? What was I to
say? I looked desperately about the big room
and its handsome fittings, at the side-table where
I used to sit with my notes.</p>

<p>“<em>Why?</em>” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I cried angrily. “Does it matter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. Why did you run away?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. He couldn’t <em>make</em> me
say....</p>

<p>“<em>Why?</em>” he repeated mercilessly. “Was it
because of what occurred the morning before
that tussle of ours with the Bay, that time you
were so reluctantly compelled to save my
life?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>yes!</em> if you must bring that up again!”
I threw at him, struggling to call back the
helpful, self-respecting anger which I’d been able
to feel quite easily then. “It’s all done with
now, so——”</p>

<p>“So it <em>was</em> because I kissed you.”</p>

<p>“<em>Well?</em>”</p>

<p>He stood looking at me. I couldn’t look at
him, but I held my head up and stared hard at
a distant pale-green wall.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you <em>surprised</em> at that? Any
girl,” I forced myself to say, “would have been
furious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<p>“You mean,” quickly, “that any girl is furious
when she’s kissed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>I</em> don’t know. I’m not thinking of
other girls!”</p>

<p>“Any girl <em>I</em> kissed, then?”</p>

<p>“No”—the Charrier girl’s face flashed before
me, and a bitter little laugh escaped me as I
spoke—“oh, <em>no</em>.”</p>

<p>“You mean only yourself, then?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but——”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> objected, strenuously enough. Why?”</p>

<p>“‘<em>Why?</em>’—”</p>

<p>“Was it”—he was cross-examining me again—“because
it was I who kissed you, or,” he paused,
“because it was a merely official lover who did
so?”</p>

<p>I was caught; there was no direct answer I
could make.</p>

<p>“I hated it!” I cried defensively.</p>

<p>He varied the form, not the question.</p>

<p>“It, or the circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Anything you like.”</p>

<p>“But which?” he persisted. “There’s a
world of difference between the two. If you
please, Miss Trant—”</p>

<p>(How dared he use that authoritative tone for
which I detested and adored him so!)</p>

<p>—“I want to know which it was?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would stay”—I tried to
fence—“after being treated like that? It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
was”—I groped for a strong enough word—“infamous
of you, Mr. Waters!”</p>

<p>“Of me?” he said. “It would have been
equally so of any man?”</p>

<p>“Far worse of <em>you</em>!” I blurted out before I
could recall it.</p>

<p>“Why? Because I’d no right?—But nor
has any other man, apparently?” he added
questioningly.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>none</em>.”</p>

<p>“Then,” he said, and it sounded almost
triumphant, “am <em>I</em> so specially hateful to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes?</em>” he caught up.</p>

<p>“<em>No!</em> Oh—” I felt myself shaking all
over as I tried to wriggle out of this corner into
which he’d got me. What was he doing?
Had he guessed? Guessed that I cared?
Then why drive it home?... It was worse
than cruelty ... it was—“anything you like,
if you must go on like this. Only—please—please
<em>don’t</em> ask—anything.” And I stopped
on the sob that I could only just keep back.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said slowly. Still I couldn’t look
at him, but I heard a change in his voice as he
added, “Very well; what excuse do you expect
me to offer?”</p>

<p>“Excuse?” I flamed. I was too afraid I
should break down in earnest and disgrace myself.
“There <em>is</em> no excuse you can possibly make.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t there? There might be more than
one, I think,” he said, quite gently still. “I
might put forward, for instance, that I’m only
an ordinary man, subject to temptation, and
that you—if you’ll allow me to say so, Miss
Trant—are a very lovely girl.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no! Don’t!” I cried out, stung.
“<em>Not</em> that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” he broke in promptly, but
still quietly. A second’s pause, then—</p>

<p>“There <em>would</em> be no excuse for snatching at
you like that, Nancy, if there weren’t a reason.
And the reason, if you really haven’t guessed it,
is, as it happens——”</p>

<p>Once before, that day, three words from him
had made a series of situations crumble away and
become as though they’d never been. Once
again a whole set of relations—that between
a typist and the head of the firm; that between
a paid official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> and her employer; that
between a man and a girl who played that
drawn game of platonic friendship; that other
between two who quarrelled and fenced and
misunderstood and hurt each other and themselves
so cruelly—was brushed aside by another
three words.</p>

<p>Billy Waters, still standing there and looking
down gravely at me, said very simply, “I love
you.”</p>

<p>What could I say? I was too dazed. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
gasped, as when at Porth Cariad I waded out for
a swim, and a racing wave met me and dashed
above my breast, catching my breath. Sentences
formed themselves and died away before I
opened my lips.</p>

<p>“You can’t mean——” “Then why——” “A
mistake——” “This is the first gleam I’ve had
that you——” “If it’s because you’re <em>sorry</em>——”
Then, of them all, I could catch firmly at only
one thought. I said breathlessly, holding the
arm of the chair, “<em>But that girl</em>——”</p>

<p>“Won’t you understand? I never gave her
a thought of that sort, or she me,” he declared
rapidly, “except about how we were to get out
of it. If you only knew, that unfortunate
French child and I had as much ado to keep from
getting married as some couples have to pull it
off! I tell you she and that young Lenoir—man
who’s just beaten the record for upside-down
flying—were—but it’s not <em>their</em> affair I’m
bothering about just now—it’s——”</p>

<p>“But she was so pretty!—so much smarter—she——”</p>

<p>“She was quicker than you! <em>She</em> spotted,
that day at tea in the cottage, how her plan for
me of an official <i lang="fr">fiancée</i> was working out.”</p>

<p>“<em>Her</em> plan?” Even in that moment I
remembered that the idea had never seemed quite
like him!</p>

<p>“Yes—<em>I</em> was at my wit’s end. <em>She</em> told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
the only plan was to say I was already booked!
Yes! But who to? ‘Anyone,’ she said.
‘You engage someone—like a courier, an interpreter—someone
you pay to understand it is
a farce’—(You know the way she talks!)
‘You go to an office—your own, perhaps.
You choose one of your stenographistes—you
have of them, yes?’ I told her I’d got four. I
think I said three of the lot would be more or
less impossible as a <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, but the fourth—But
never mind that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I do! What did you say about
the fourth?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” he said, laughing a little,
“some time. We have plenty of time,
I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, now,” I said. It <em>was</em> my turn to insist.
“What about the fourth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forget! Well, then,” hurriedly.
“I believe I said she seemed quite a nice, quiet,
unassuming little mouse of a person—look
here, you’ll <em>have</em> to forgive me if I do tell you!—not
particularly brilliant at her job, but
dependable; and that perhaps she <em>was</em> the kind
of girl one could take about when it seemed
necessary, and leave a good deal to one’s people—mind,
I’d scarcely <em>seen</em> you! I hadn’t seen
you! I said I thought you seemed——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, perfectly <em>tractable</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span></p>

<p>He broke off to laugh again, and moved
nearer to me.</p>

<p>“A fortnight after that, Nancy, you were
defying me in my own den! That frock, and—<em>chucking</em>
my ring about the piano! And
now ...” he said, with a hand in his jacket-pocket,
“now, Miss Trant, I’m going to put
that ring back, if I may, in its proper place.”</p>

<p>He would have taken my hand, but all in my
flurry of delight I put them both behind me.</p>

<p>“No! Wait! Your people—what will they
say to—all this?”</p>

<p>“But ... bless me! they know we’re engaged!”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>that</em> way,” I said shakily. “But <em>this</em>?”</p>

<p>“D’you suppose, Nancy-Monica Trant, that
they’re ever going to know that there’s any difference?
D’you think ‘Theo will notice’ any?
I doubt if they’d believe that yarn if we
told them! Very soon we shan’t believe it
ourselves! So——Wait? I’ve waited too
long!”</p>

<p>But I was, all of a sudden, shy of him as I’d
never been in my trembling typist days. I
put him back with a look.</p>

<p>“<em>How</em> long?” I asked falteringly. “Can’t
you tell me when?”</p>

<p>His face was full of protest, but he leaned,
half-sitting, against the edge of his desk.</p>

<p>“What can I tell you?” he said. “That it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
was just now in Battersea Park, seeing that the
girl one can’t stop squabbling with is the girl
one <em>has</em> to make love to——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but really——”</p>

<p>“Or that it was mere gratitude to you for
dragging me out of the water? Or—as soon as I
saw how disappointed my people would be if I
ever let you go. (My mother, last night!
In tears—declaring it must be all <em>my</em> temper!)
Or that—well, that as soon as I got you down
to my home I began to wonder what on earth I
was thinking of, not to see that I kept you
there.”</p>

<p>“No, but really——”</p>

<p>“Hang it all, Nancy, after all these weeks and
months!” he cried, gaily impatient, throwing
back his handsome fair head. Could I ever
have thought he wasn’t handsome? He strode
up to me, sat sideways on the green-leather arm
of my chair, put his hand in front of me on the
other arm, and so faced me. It brought his
eyes, gay with laughter and delight, nearer than
they had ever been, except once, to my face.</p>

<p>And I felt those eyes of his flash swiftly, from
the ripple of hair over my ear to the hot scarlet
wave that I knew was dyeing my cheek, then to
my mouth. And it was as though I had felt
his lips first here, then there, and then there
again, even before he drew closer yet and kissed
me as though he could not stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<p>But I pulled away. “Oh, Billy! No!
<em>Please!</em>” I heard myself sob. “I can’t bear it.
Not—not all at once. Not so <em>much</em>——”</p>

<p>“Little <em>miser</em>!” he muttered, and took my
hands down to clasp behind his neck. “Am I
<em>never</em> to be allowed anything——”</p>

<p>“But I thought——”</p>

<p>“How <em>could</em> you?” he whispered. “Haven’t
you <em>eyes</em>?... Dashing away from me like that,
before I could get in a word! You spitfire!
‘Don’t speak to me,’ at every turn! And that
first time, I was only given a scrap of your hair
to kiss!”</p>

<p>“S-sorry you don’t like my hair——”</p>

<p>“Not like it?” He pressed his cheek to it.
“Not all that lovely soft stuff that I always
wanted to touch?—and mightn’t—not even
that time after it came loose in the water—”</p>

<p>“Looking <em>horrid</em>!”</p>

<p>—“and clung all down you! D’you know
what I shall do to it, presently?”</p>

<p>I didn’t speak; I shut my eyes against his
shoulder, and sighed.... And I had once
thought I was not the “falling-in-love-type”
of girl! I had once called him “that frozen
ogre!”</p>

<p>“I shall twist this hair of yours into a great
rope of black silk,” he said, “and haul you off
by it to that cave! Only question is, how soon?
Nancy! How soon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p>“A cave?” I said, half hearing, with my
mouth against the cloth of his sleeve, “what
d’you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, the sort of cave with a rose-garden
to it, and perhaps a little white wicket-gate
at the top of the stairs—don’t you
remember?”</p>

<p class="tb">But we’d certainly forgotten the author of
that long-ago <i lang="fr">contretemps</i> at the breakfast-table
of The Lawn, the elderly <i lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> of that
age-old week-end! Our heads were close together
over the date-ticket that the head of the
firm had grabbed from his desk to reckon up
“how soon it could possibly be,” my finger with
the ring on it was caught between his lips, when
the briefest of taps at the door was followed
by the most sudden of entrances—by Uncle
Albert Waters.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he began, “what’s to be done
now?” His rosy, John Bull face was unrecognizably
worried, but it suddenly lighted
up. “What, the little girl too?”</p>

<p>I had sprung away—I hope!—before he could
have noticed that there, in that most official-looking
of offices, I had been sitting on his
nephew’s knee; but I was still so fluttered that
I could think of nothing to do but offer the old
gentleman my cheek! At all events, <em>he</em> was
absurdly pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Nancy</em>, my dear!... But what brought
<em>you</em> back to London?”</p>

<p>“Furnishing,” said Billy, without a quiver.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it, my boy! First bit of good
news to-day,” said Mr. Waters, turning grave
again. “I say, Billy! About this——”</p>

<p>“I’m going,” I said quickly, picking my hat
up from the side-table where it had been tossed
down as upon a gorse-bush. “I only meant
to stay a minute.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nancy</em>—I say!” came resentfully from the
desk.</p>

<p>“I’ll be in the waiting-room, then,” I promised.
“Or, if I may, I’ll go and look up Miss
Robinson and the girls while you talk over your
business.”</p>

<p>I don’t know why, exactly. Only I felt I
must see those three girls again with this new
look on my face. They might not know the
difference! Still—I walked to the door.</p>

<p>“Sensible little woman, this of yours,
William,” his uncle trumpeted approvingly,
holding it open for me. “Knows there’s a time
for everything.... All to yourself for good,
presently; <em>that’s</em> been official for months now.
Don’t you glower at me, lad, I saw you——”</p>

<p>The door shut behind me. But through it I
heard Uncle Albert’s robustious: “Why! Bless
my life! Anyone would think I’d interrupted
you before you’d been engaged five minutes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT<br />
<span class="smaller">FULL MOON</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“This,” said Billy, taking in a full breath
of the sea-scented air of Porth Cariad,
“is better than your old idea of a Riviera honeymoon,
Nancy!”</p>

<p>We had just walked down from the larger of
the cottages towards the shore, and were watching
that great primrose-coloured Chinese lantern
of a moon rise slowly, slowly over the jagged,
purple silhouette of the Carnarvonshire mountains
into the pale mauve September dusk.</p>

<p>Presently it would cast a glittering path of
light across the Bay of Many Waters, and throw
a black shadow from the cliff of the wooden
woman on to the sands of our cove. There was
a soft lap-lapping of the high tide beneath us,
and a softer scurrying of rabbits among the sand-hills;
now and again a gull called, or we caught
the distant shouts of the men in the fishing-boats
putting out for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span></p>

<p>Beyond these small sounds there was a great
and brooding Peace; we were two hundred
miles and more from the noise and sunshine and
merriment of the morning, from the great green
lawn sown with all the colour and movement of
the wedding-party, living confetti!—from the
white house, echoing with laughter, and
voices—Theo’s above the rest—calling far
after us: “Good luck! Good luck!”</p>

<p>“And are you glad to be back here, with me,
to-night?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” I said dreamily, “we’ll go
everywhere where we used to go——”</p>

<p>“Over to that cliff, Nancy——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and finish painting that figure-head——”</p>

<p>“Yes, or <em>not</em> finish painting her. We’ve
wasted too much good time at Port Sweetheart
as it is!”</p>

<p>But I felt that all our time here had all been
so lovely—all! And now, this cool white radiance
was bathing the place in a light more magical
than any day I had seen. It made of it one of
those dream-countries one walks in, half-waking,
as a child: a wide and lonely, lovely land;
secret, too! of which one would not give the
entrance to one’s very dearest; a land I had
scarcely dreamed of since I was a half-grown
girl. Why did those dreams come back to me
now? I stared out to sea; I didn’t want to
move or speak; just to be there, watching that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
moonlight on those waves, was enough. I
was as still as that image of that other girl, high
up on the cliff....</p>

<p>At that moment I felt ... not myself at all,
but outside myself and part of it all—of the
quivering, whispering sea under that chill and
silver light, of those fairy hills, of the sighing,
cool air, and of the dewy earth. There was
something of all these in my own being—something
of mine in all of them. For that
one moment I had forgotten the lover beside
me; for just that last rapt moment he was
nothing to me....</p>

<p>Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“The lights on the boats down there ...
like glow-worms! Only those are putting out to
sea. And a glow-worm lights up—did you
know why? to guide its mate home.”</p>

<p>I sighed; slowly, slowly growing back again,
out of the inhuman white glamour and that
silver distance....</p>

<p>“Are there,” I asked, a little absently, “any
glow-worms in this place?”</p>

<p>“Further inland, perhaps,” he said.</p>

<p>Very gently, he drew me round to face the
cottages. A warmer, dimmer, rosier light
streamed through the door of the kitchen, where
we caught the pinky round globe of the lamp,
the gleam of the white cloth, the small, dark,
cosy shape of Mrs. Roberts moving to and fro,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
setting, with a little chinking of plates and forks,
our supper.</p>

<p>She came to the door and called in her insidious
voice, “<i lang="cy">Mae’n barod rwan, sir!</i>”</p>

<p>“That means it’s ready now,” said Billy
softly. “Come in, dear. Yes—those lights are
outward-bound, Nancy. But you—you’re anchored,
aren’t you? All fast?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but as I love to be,” I said, this time with
a happy sigh; and turned—to his breast.</p>

<p>He clasped me, crushing against my neck a
kiss that has left there, rosy and distinct, the
impression of a chain....</p>

<p>It’s that slender gold chain which holds the
little oval pendant framing a christening-curl.
His mother fastened that gift beneath the white
shimmer of my bridal-gown this morning.</p>

<p>And I remember something that she said when
first she offered it.</p>

<p>Presently, I shall tell my husband what it was.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
